    "This notebook is designed to read data from XML that we transformed from its original output JSON from the generalized sentiment analysis reading. The research question is to learn more about the language associated with the \"good,\" \"bad,\" and \"N\" readouts from the initial sentiment analysis pass. We can investigate nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, or distinctly identify phrases associated with sentiment in the scraped news. \n",
