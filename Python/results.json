        "The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped Monday to kick off the second quarter, with traders weighing fresh U.S. inflation data amid fears that the market rally could slow down.The Dow lost 254 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped less than 0.1%.Investors remain cautious about the pace of the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting timeline this year and how soon central bankers will be able to meet their 2% inflation target. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that economic growth remains strong and inflation is still above target.\"That means we don't need to be in a hurry to cut,\" the central bank chief told public radio's \"Marketplace\" program. \"The economy is strong right now, and the labor market is strong right now. And inflation has been coming down. We can and we will be careful about this decision because we can be.\"Treasury yields rose following the data release and Powell's remarks. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was up more than 11 basis points at 4.303%.Markets also reacted to the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, released Friday during the market closure for Good Friday, which showed inflation rose 2.8% in February, in line with expectations. The inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve also rose 0.3% from a month ago, the Commerce Department said.The major averages are coming off a winning first quarter. The S&P 500 jumped 10.2% for its best first-quarter performance since 2019, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 5.6%. The Nasdaq Composite popped 9.1%.Wall Street also wrapped up a winning March and its fifth consecutive positive month. Those monthly and quarterly gains brought the Dow to within striking distance of 40,000. However, Monday's decline pulled it away from the milestone level.\"The market is overbought by any measure,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. \"At some point, we will see a pullback, and then at that point, you'll start to hear the bears come out again suggesting that it's deeper than just a healthy correction.\"\"The market needs a correction in order to start seeing more money come in from money market accounts and to feel more constructive,\" Krosby added.Correction: The S&P 500 had its best first-quarter performance since 2019. A previous version misstated the milestone.\n": {

        "In this articleTesla\u00a0shares fell on Tuesday after the company reported a drop in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, the first annual decline since 2020, when the global pandemic disrupted production.Here are the key numbers:Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810Total production Q1 2024: 433,371Vehicle production declined around 1.7% from a year earlier and 12.5% sequentially for Tesla, not nearly as steeply as the 8.5% annual drop in deliveries.Tesla doesn't break out sales by model but reported it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.In the same period last year, the\u00a0electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.Tesla's deliveries for the quarter fell far below even the most bearish of analysts' expectations.According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ended March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.Tesla's head of investor relations, Martin Viecha, sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts' estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla's component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.Tesla said in a statement that \"decline in volumes was partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont [California] factory and factory shutdowns.\"In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers' schedules to five days a week from 6\u00bd days.In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla's newest model \u2014 an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck \u2014 which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company's premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn't make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Prospective Tesla customers in the U.S. comprised a shrinking group in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report by Reuters citing survey data from Caliber. The report attributed the drop in part to Musk's persona.Musk has continued to bet that Tesla customers and shareholders will stick with the brand and company regardless of his politics and incendiary rhetoric on and beyond X, which he owns.Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company's IPO in 2010. The stock was down about 4.4% to $167.55 as of Tuesday afternoon.The company has scheduled an earnings call for April 23 to discuss quarterly results.WATCH: Tesla is going through 'code red situation'\n": {

Sethi said the market remains strong and pointed to pockets of opportunity in sectors outside of technology, such as energy, which was one of two sectors in the green on Tuesday.Tuesday's market losses come after February's core personal consumption expenditures price index released Friday showed a 2.8% annual increase, about even with December and January's 2.9% rate, and still a ways to go from the Fed's 2% inflation target.

        "Private sector job growth expanded in March at its fastest pace since July 2023, indicating continuing buoyance in the U.S. labor market, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.Companies added 184,000 workers on the month, an increase from the upwardly revised February gain of 155,000, which also was the Dow Jones estimate for March.In addition to the strong employment pickup, ADP reported that wages for workers who stayed in their jobs increased 5.1% from a year ago, the same rate as February after showing a steady easing going well back into 2023. Those switching jobs saw gains of 10%, also higher than in previous months.\"March was surprising not just for the pay gains, but the sectors that recorded them,\" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. \"Inflation has been cooling, but our data shows pay is heating up in both goods and services.\"Job gains were fairly broad-based, led by leisure and hospitality with 63,000. Other sectors showing significant increases included construction (33,000), trade, transportation and utilities (29,000), and education and health services (17,000). Professional and business services saw a loss of 8,000.Services-related industries accounted for 142,000 of the total, with goods providing the rest. ADP, whose survey is based on payroll data analysis of more than 25 million workers, does not track government jobs.Most of the growth came from companies that employ more than 50 workers, with small businesses adding just 16,000 to the total. From a regional standpoint, the South saw the biggest gains, adding 91,000 workers.The ADP estimate serves as a precursor to the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls survey, set to be released Friday, though the numbers often diverge sharply. The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported job growth of 275,000 in February, or 120,000 more than even ADP's revised figure. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the March count to show growth of 200,000.Solid payroll growth along with easing inflation has allowed the Federal Reserve to be patient in its approach to easing monetary policy. Central bank officials expect to start cutting interest rates later this year but have said in recent days that they haven't seen enough evidence yet that inflation is on a sustained path lower to begin reductions.\n": {

        "Billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen said Wednesday that it will be difficult for the Federal Reserve to get inflation back down to its 2% goal.\"The Fed thinks it's eventually going to come down to a 2% inflation rate. ... I think that's going to be hard,\" Cohen told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on \"Squawk Box.\"Inflation was falling in late 2023, but there were several upside surprises in that data during the first quarter of this year. That has led to concern among economists and traders that inflation may prove to be \"sticky\" above the Fed's target level, complicating the path for rate cuts.The Point72 CEO said Wednesday that there's a lot of \"underemployment\" in the country, which could create upward pressure on inflation if economic growth remains strong.\"If growth is too fast, then you start getting constraints on labor and wages go up, and that may be a problem. ... We're in one of these problems where I don't think many people know exactly what is going to happen,\" Cohen said.Despite his concerns on inflation, Cohen said he doesn't disagree with market estimates of three cuts this year.\"I think inflation's been somewhat contained, and I think ultimately it will come down to: is that a true statement or not,\" Cohen said.Cohen also expressed general confidence in the stock market.

        "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday it will take a while for policymakers to evaluate the current state of inflation, keeping the timing of potential interest rate cuts uncertain.Speaking specifically about stronger-than-expected price pressures to start the year, the central bank leader said he and his fellow officials are in no rush to ease monetary policy.Watch Fed Chair Powell speak live at Stanford policy conference economic forum\"On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,\" Powell said in remarks ahead of a question-and-answer session at Stanford University.\"We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent,\" he added. \"Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy.\"The remarks come two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold benchmark short-term borrowing rates steady. In addition, the committee's post-meeting statement on March 20 included the \"greater confidence\" qualifier needed before cutting.Markets widely expect the FOMC to start easing policy this year, though they have had to recalibrate their outlook for the timing and extent of cuts as inflation has held stubbornly higher. Other economic variables, particularly in the labor market and consumer spending, have held up as well, giving the Fed time to assess the current state of affairs before moving.The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed a 12-month rate of 2.5% for February, or 2.8% for the pivotal core measure that excludes food and energy. Virtually all other inflation gauges show rates in excess of 3%.\"Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected,\" Powell said. \"The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.\"Other Fed officials speaking this week have made remarks consistent with the Fed's patient approach.Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC on Wednesday that he thinks just one cut might be in the offing as prices of some important items have turned higher. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said three cuts is a \"reasonable baseline\" but noted there are no guarantees, while Cleveland's Loretta Mester also said cuts are likely later this year while adding that rates over the longer term may be higher than anticipated. All three are FOMC voters.Powell reiterated that decisions are being made \"meeting by meeting\" and noted only that cuts are \"likely to be appropriate ... at some point this year.\"The uncertainty about rates has caused some consternation in markets, with stocks falling sharply earlier this week as Treasury yields moved higher. The market stabilized Wednesday, but traders in the fed funds futures market again repriced their rate expectations, casting some doubt on a June cut as the market-implied probability moved to about 54% at one point, according to CME Group data.Along with his comments on rates, Powell spent some time discussing Fed independence.With the presidential election campaign heating up, Powell noted the importance of steering clear of political issues.\"Our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to the public,\" he said. \"We will not always get it right \u2014 no one does. But our decisions will always reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and longer term \u2014 and nothing else.\"He also talked about \"mission creep,\" specifically as it relates to some demand for the Fed to get involved in climate change issues and the preparations financial institutions take for related events.\"We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers,\" he said.\n": {

        "In this articleDisney shareholders on Wednesday reelected the media conglomerate's full board, preliminary results show, handing a stinging defeat to activist Nelson Peltz and former Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter, both of whom agitated for change at one of America's most storied companies.The widely expected victory caps a combative months-long process and affirms the board's decisions, from the move to bring back CEO Bob Iger to his efforts to re-invigorate the $223 billion media company. Peltz and Trian wanted to oust two directors \u2014 Maria Elena Lagomasino and Michael Froman \u2014 citing sustained share underperformance, a failed succession process, and billions in misdirected investments.Peltz lost to Lagomasino by a two-to-one margin, a person familiar with the matter said. Retail voters overwhelmingly supported Disney, that person added, helping to deliver Iger 94% of the overall vote. Rasulo lost to Lagomasino by an even larger margin, five votes against for every one for. That person characterized it as Peltz's largest loss ever.Percentage-wise, turnout for the director vote was in the mid-sixties, another person familiar with the matter said. In 2023, around 63% of Disney shareholders voted.A second activist, Blackwells, also failed to win board seats in its own long-shot bid.\"I\u00a0want to thank our shareholders for their trust and confidence in our Board and management. With the distracting proxy contest now behind us, we're eager to focus 100% of our attention on our most important priorities: growth and value creation for our shareholders and creative excellence for our consumers,\" Iger said in a release.Disney deployed significant resources in the proxy fight. The company called in support from its founding family, Star Wars creator George Lucas, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Pixar and Apple CEO Steve Jobs.\"While we are disappointed with the outcome of this proxy contest, Trian greatly appreciates all of the support and dialogue we have had with Disney stakeholders. We are proud of the impact we have had in refocusing this Company on value creation and good governance,\" Trian said in a statement.The company also spent an estimated $40 million fighting off Peltz. The full-court press worked. Disney's two largest shareholders, Vanguard and Blackrock, decided to back management in the final days before Wednesday's meeting.\"Blackwells' primary objective was achieved \u2013 keeping Nelson Peltz out of the Disney Boardroom,\" Blackwells said in a statement. \"The company would have benefited from any one of our candidates for the hard work needed over the next few years to advance this iconic company, but we respect the will of the shareholders and the outcome.\"Ultimately, the activists failed to convince enough retail or institutional shareholders that he had a meaningful plan to fix the House of Mouse. While Peltz's candidacy picked up meaningful support from proxy advisors and smaller institutional investors, shareholders were less compelled by former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo, whom Trian also nominated to the board.Peltz, who dislikes being called an activist but has orchestrated successful campaigns at iconic companies like PepsiCo, P&G and Wendy's, controls a $3.98 billion stake in Disney, or about 2% of total shares outstanding. Most of those shares are owned by Perlmutter.With Disney shares up nearly 50% since Peltz's campaign first began, Trian and Perlmutter gained a lot despite their board defeat. Peltz is partially on the hook for an estimated $25 million spent on the fight, a small amount compared to the paper gains in the stake he controls.As it moves past the battle with Peltz, Disney still faces down unprecedented challenges. ESPN has shed subscribers for years, raising questions about whether it is prepared to go toe-to-toe with streaming upstarts. Disney's streaming business has spent billions to win subscribers and is losing money as it tries to catch up to market leader Netflix.Perhaps most significantly, the company is searching for a successor to Iger for the second time in five years. Disney's botched succession, where Iger's hand-picked replacement Bob Chapek was ousted just two years into his tenure, was a key point Trian used against the company.\"Thank you for your trust and confidence in the Disney project management, and the ambitious strategy we're implementing across our businesses to build for the future,\" Iger said after the preliminary vote was reported. \"Now that this distracting proxy contest is behind us, we're here to focus 100% of our attention on our most important priorities, growth and value creation for our shareholders and creative excellence for our consumers. Thank you again for your support and for your continued investment in this.\"There is evidence that major proxy advisors agreed with Peltz's argument that the board was ill-equipped to take on a second search process.Shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS both noted the succession issues in their recommendations to investors. Glass Lewis sided with Disney and asserted Iger's return, paired with this year's nominations of Morgan Stanley Chairman James Gorman and former Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch to the board, have given the company \"adequate opportunity to launch a more credible succession program and develop, communicate and execute on several key initiatives which appear to reasonably target acknowledged operational and financial weaknesses at Disney.\"Investors rallied around Disney in February after the company made a series of major announcements durings its earnings call, including that it had obtained the exclusive streaming rights to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert film, a $1.5 billion strategic investment in Epic Games as well as a flagship ESPN streaming service.Peltz called the slew of announcements a \"spaghetti-against-the-wall\" plan that was meant to \"distract shareholders.\"Shares of Disney have jumped 23% since Disney's fiscal first quarter earnings report in early February.Disclosure: Sky News is owned by Comcast, CNBC's parent company.\n": {

The company called in support from its founding family, Star Wars creator George Lucas, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Pixar and Apple CEO Steve Jobs.While Peltz will not end up on the Disney board, he and his firm have claimed some credit for the rebound in the company's shares.\"While we are disappointed with the outcome of this proxy contest, Trian greatly appreciates all of the support and dialogue we have had with Disney stakeholders. We are proud of the impact we have had in refocusing this Company on value creation and good governance,\" Trian said in a statement.The company also spent an estimated $40 million fighting off Peltz. The full-court press worked. Disney's two largest shareholders, Vanguard and Blackrock, decided to back management in the final days before Wednesday's meeting.Ultimately, the activists failed to convince enough retail or institutional shareholders that he had a meaningful plan to fix the House of Mouse. While Peltz's candidacy picked up meaningful support from proxy advisors and smaller institutional investors, shareholders were less compelled by former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo, whom Trian also nominated to the board.Though its choices did not win board seats, Blackwells cheered the fact that Peltz was not elected.\"Blackwells' primary objective was achieved \u2013 keeping Nelson Peltz out of the Disney Boardroom,\" Blackwells said in a statement. \"The company would have benefited from any one of our candidates for the hard work needed over the next few years to advance this iconic company, but we respect the will of the shareholders and the outcome.\"Peltz, who dislikes being called an activist but has orchestrated successful campaigns at iconic companies like PepsiCo, P&G and Wendy's, controls a $3.98 billion stake in Disney, or about 2% of total shares outstanding. Most of those shares are owned by Perlmutter.With Disney shares up nearly 50% since Peltz's campaign first began, Trian and Perlmutter gained a lot despite their board defeat. Peltz is partially on the hook for an estimated $25 million spent on the fight, a small amount compared to the paper gains in the stake he controls.As it moves past the battle with Peltz, Disney still faces down unprecedented challenges. ESPN has shed subscribers for years, raising questions about whether it is prepared to go toe-to-toe with streaming upstarts. Disney's streaming business has spent billions to win subscribers and is losing money as it tries to catch up to market leader Netflix.Perhaps most significantly, the company is searching for a successor to Iger for the second time in five years. Disney's botched succession, where Iger's hand-picked replacement Bob Chapek was ousted just two years into his tenure, was a key point Trian used against the company.\"Thank you for your trust and confidence in the Disney project management, and the ambitious strategy we're implementing across our businesses to build for the future,\" Iger said after the preliminary vote was reported. \"Now that this distracting proxy contest is behind us, we're here to focus 100% of our attention on our most important priorities, growth and value creation for our shareholders and creative excellence for our consumers. Thank you again for your support and for your continued investment in this.\"There is evidence that major proxy advisors agreed with Peltz's argument that the board was ill-equipped to take on a second search process.Shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS both noted the succession issues in their recommendations to investors. Glass Lewis sided with Disney and asserted Iger's return, paired with this year's nominations of Morgan Stanley Chairman James Gorman and former Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch to the board, have given the company \"adequate opportunity to launch a more credible succession program and develop, communicate and execute on several key initiatives which appear to reasonably target acknowledged operational and financial weaknesses at Disney.\"Investors rallied around Disney in February after the company made a series of major announcements durings its earnings call, including that it had obtained the exclusive streaming rights to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert film, a $1.5 billion strategic investment in Epic Games as well as a flagship ESPN streaming service.Peltz called the slew of announcements a \"spaghetti-against-the-wall\" plan that was meant to \"distract shareholders.\"Shares of Disney have jumped 23% since Disney's fiscal first quarter earnings report in early February.Disclosure: Sky News is owned by Comcast, CNBC's parent company.\n": {

        "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday it will take a while for policymakers to evaluate the current state of inflation, keeping the timing of potential interest rate cuts uncertain.Speaking specifically about stronger-than-expected price pressures to start the year, the central bank leader said he and his fellow officials are in no rush to ease monetary policy.Watch Fed Chair Powell speak live at Stanford policy conference economic forum\"On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,\" Powell said in remarks ahead of a question-and-answer session at Stanford University.\"We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent,\" he added. \"Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy.\"The remarks come two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold benchmark short-term borrowing rates steady. In addition, the committee's post-meeting statement on March 20 included the \"greater confidence\" qualifier needed before cutting.Markets widely expect the FOMC to start easing policy this year, though they have had to recalibrate their outlook for the timing and extent of cuts as inflation has held stubbornly higher. Other economic variables, particularly in the labor market and consumer spending, have held up as well, giving the Fed time to assess the current state of affairs before moving.The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed a 12-month rate of 2.5% for February, or 2.8% for the pivotal core measure that excludes food and energy. Virtually all other inflation gauges show rates in excess of 3%.\"Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected,\" Powell said. \"The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.\"Other Fed officials speaking this week have made remarks consistent with the Fed's patient approach.Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC on Wednesday that he thinks just one cut might be in the offing as prices of some important items have turned higher. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said three cuts is a \"reasonable baseline\" but noted there are no guarantees, while Cleveland's Loretta Mester also said cuts are likely later this year while adding that rates over the longer term may be higher than anticipated. All three are FOMC voters.Powell reiterated that decisions are being made \"meeting by meeting\" and noted only that cuts are \"likely to be appropriate ... at some point this year.\"The uncertainty about rates has caused some consternation in markets, with stocks falling sharply earlier this week as Treasury yields moved higher. The market stabilized Wednesday, but traders in the fed funds futures market again repriced their rate expectations, casting some doubt on a June cut as the market-implied probability moved to about 54% at one point, according to CME Group data.Along with his comments on rates, Powell spent some time discussing Fed independence.With the presidential election campaign heating up, Powell noted the importance of steering clear of political issues.\"Our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to the public,\" he said. \"We will not always get it right \u2014 no one does. But our decisions will always reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and longer term \u2014 and nothing else.\"He also talked about \"mission creep,\" specifically as it relates to some demand for the Fed to get involved in climate change issues and the preparations financial institutions take for related events.\"We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers,\" he said.Correction: Powell's remarks come two weeks after the Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold rates steady. An earlier version misstated the timing. Raphael Bostic is president of the Atlanta Fed. An earlier version misstated the city. \n": {
