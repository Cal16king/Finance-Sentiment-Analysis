Stocks tumbled Thursday after the latest U.S. economic data showed a sharp slowdown in growth and pointed to persistent inflation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 352 points, or 0.9%, weighed down by steep declines in Caterpillar and IBM. The S&P 500 dropped 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7%.U.S. gross domestic product expanded 1.6% in the first quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast GDP growth would come in at 2.4%.Along with the downbeat growth rate for the quarter, the report showed consumer prices increased at a 3.4% pace, well above the previous quarter's 1.8% advance. This raised concern over persistent inflation and put into question whether the Federal Reserve will be able to cut rates anytime soon. Taken together, both findings suggest a stagflationary environment — that is, a combination of slowing economic growth and rising inflation — and could add another headwind to policymakers moving forward."In the short term, the numbers don't appear to be a green light for either bulls or bears...the uncertainty is unlikely to ease pressures in a market experiencing its deepest pullback since last year," said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.Following the GDP print, traders moved down expectations for an easing of Federal Reserve monetary policy. Fed funds futures trading data suggests there will be just one interest rate cut this year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.The lackluster GDP added further pressure to an already-tense market contending with concerns over a pullback in growth among technology earnings.Meta plunged 11% after the social media giant issued light revenue guidance for the second quarter. That would be the stock's biggest one-day decline since October 2022. International Business Machines also fell 8% after missing consensus estimates for first-quarter revenue."For all of the attention given to generative AI in the past nine months, the failure of Meta to attain its revenue growth projections in Q1 is raising questions about whether the monetization of this technology is as easy as what traders were led to believe by management," said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie.Meta's report raises concern ahead of other big tech releases.

It's now a real concern, and continuing data is reinforcing that, which is what the PCE price data shows us. The Fed is kind of boxed in a corner here," he added.— Jesse PoundAlthough GDP in the January-through-March period grew less than expected — while the inflation posted its biggest gain in a year — the economy is at little risk of falling into stagflation, according to BMO Wealth Management chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma."We actually think growth is going to hold up pretty well," Ma said. Much of the detractors of GDP growth were volatile one-time items, such as inventories, Ma noted, as well as underscoring strength in consumer and business spending."We see a pretty healthy and stable growth environment; we aren't especially concerned about growth pulling back much throughout this year. We actually think there's a good prospect for acceleration as we go throughout the year," said Ma.Ma forecasts prices for most services and goods to moderate in the remainder of 2024."This GDP report might might actually mark a high point of worry for both inflation concerns and growth this year. We think both are going to turn the corner positive direction," Ma said. "It might take a little bit of time, but we we don't we don't see these trends persisting throughout this year."With a forecast for a healthy growth environment, albeit a relatively neutral environment for inflation with regards to the Federal Reserve, Ma believes there is still a favorable backdrop for equities in 2024."It's not as favorable — but it's still a backdrop that we wouldn't recommend investors take an overly conservative or cautious stance in the face of this outlook," Ma said.— Hakyung KimTechnology investor Paul Meeks is standing by Meta Platforms despite Thursday's sell-off, but said it's too soon to snatch up shares just yet.The stock needs to "find support for at least a few trading session, so I'm more confident that the short-term selling has been exhausted," said the co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Harvest Portfolio Management.Meeks considers himself a long-term owner of the stock, but said he's waiting for more earnings reports to trickle in.
