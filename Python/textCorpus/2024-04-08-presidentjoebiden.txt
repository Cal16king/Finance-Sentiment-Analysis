President Joe Biden will unveil his new plan to forgive student debt on Monday, less than a year after the Supreme Court blocked his initial attempt.Biden wants this aid package to survive any legal challenges.

"Erasing that debt will lessen the burden of student loan debt on millions of borrowers and allow them to pay off their loans in a timely manner."In addition to the cancellation of interest, Biden's new plan is also expected to forgive the debt of certain groups of borrowers, including those who:It's not entirely clear yet how financial hardship will be defined, but it could include those burdened by medical debt or high child care expenses, the Biden administration said.Biden originally attempted to cancel people's student debt through executive action, but he's now turned to the rulemaking process. The next step in that procedure is for the Biden administration to issue a proposed rule on its plan, which will be followed by a public comment period.The president hopes to begin forgiving student debt before the November election.
