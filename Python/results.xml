		<key name="The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped Monday to kick off the second quarter, with traders weighing fresh U.S. inflation data amid fears that the market rally could slow down.The Dow lost 254 points, or 0.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 shed 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped less than 0.1%.Investors remain cautious about the pace of the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting timeline this year and how soon central bankers will be able to meet their 2% inflation target. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that economic growth remains strong and inflation is still above target.&quot;That means we don't need to be in a hurry to cut,&quot; the central bank chief told public radio's &quot;Marketplace&quot; program. &quot;The economy is strong right now, and the labor market is strong right now. And inflation has been coming down. We can and we will be careful about this decision because we can be.&quot;Treasury yields rose following the data release and Powell's remarks. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was up more than 11 basis points at 4.303%.Markets also reacted to the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, released Friday during the market closure for Good Friday, which showed inflation rose 2.8% in February, in line with expectations. The inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve also rose 0.3% from a month ago, the Commerce Department said.The major averages are coming off a winning first quarter. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 10.2% for its best first-quarter performance since 2019, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 5.6%. The Nasdaq Composite popped 9.1%.Wall Street also wrapped up a winning March and its fifth consecutive positive month. Those monthly and quarterly gains brought the Dow to within striking distance of 40,000. However, Monday's decline pulled it away from the milestone level.&quot;The market is overbought by any measure,&quot; said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. &quot;At some point, we will see a pullback, and then at that point, you'll start to hear the bears come out again suggesting that it's deeper than just a healthy correction.&quot;&quot;The market needs a correction in order to start seeing more money come in from money market accounts and to feel more constructive,&quot; Krosby added.Correction: The S&amp;P 500 had its best first-quarter performance since 2019. A previous version misstated the milestone. " type="dict">

		<key name="In this article Tesla shares fell on Tuesday after the company reported a drop in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, the first annual decline since 2020, when the global pandemic disrupted production.Here are the key numbers:Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810Total production Q1 2024: 433,371Vehicle production declined around 1.7% from a year earlier and 12.5% sequentially for Tesla, not nearly as steeply as the 8.5% annual drop in deliveries.Tesla doesn't break out sales by model but reported it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.Tesla's deliveries for the quarter fell far below even the most bearish of analysts' expectations.According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ended March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.Tesla's head of investor relations, Martin Viecha, sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts' estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla's component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.Tesla said in a statement that &quot;decline in volumes was partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont [California] factory and factory shutdowns.&quot;In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers' schedules to five days a week from 6½ days.In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla's newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company's premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn't make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Prospective Tesla customers in the U.S. comprised a shrinking group in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report by Reuters citing survey data from Caliber. The report attributed the drop in part to Musk's persona.Musk has continued to bet that Tesla customers and shareholders will stick with the brand and company regardless of his politics and incendiary rhetoric on and beyond X, which he owns.Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company's IPO in 2010. The stock was down about 4.4% to $167.55 as of Tuesday afternoon.The company has scheduled an earnings call for April 23 to discuss quarterly results.WATCH: Tesla is going through 'code red situation' " type="dict">

		<key name="The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a second day, continuing Wall Street's lackluster start to the quarter, as bond yields increased and traders lowered expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in June.The 30-stock Dow dropped 425 points, or 1.1%. At its session low, the benchmark was down more than 500 points. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.2%.The second quarter for stocks is off to a rough start as sticky inflation data to end last week and some strong economic data Monday sends yields higher and reduces odds the Fed will cut rates in June. Stocks came under pressure Tuesday as the rate on the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to its highest level since Nov. 28. Oil prices also surged to highs last seen five months ago. &quot;What we're seeing is a one-two punch with the combination of continued hot inflation data with profit taking,&quot; said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. With &quot;very significant Q1 market gains … we're due for a little correction. But we think that the investor narrative also continues to be higher for longer with respect to interest rates.&quot;The S&amp;P 500 is coming off a 10% gain for the first quarter, its best start to a year since 2019, as investors bet inflation would come down enough for the Fed to start cutting rates while the economy keeps growing. The Nasdaq gained 9% in the first quarter on the back of a run in artificial intelligence-related stocks such as Nvidia.Sarat Sethi, managing partner at Douglas C. Lane &amp; Associates, remained unfazed by the sell-off and called it a &quot;natural digestion&quot; after equities have come up fast and quickly. Sethi said the market remains strong and pointed to pockets of opportunity in sectors outside of technology, such as energy, which was one of two sectors in the green on Tuesday.Tuesday's market losses come after February's core personal consumption expenditures price index released Friday showed a 2.8% annual increase, about even with December and January's 2.9% rate, and still a ways to go from the Fed's 2% inflation target. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing gauge showed expansion for the first time since Sept. 2022.Odds for a June rate cut based on fed futures trading are now down to about 58.8%, off from about 70% a week ago. The question now is if the momentum to start 2024 can continue if the Fed stands pat on rates.Tesla shares slid about 5% after publishing disappointing first-quarter deliveries. Tech-related giants Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft, some of this year's big winners, were down roughly 1%.Health insurers slid after the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services finalized the 2025 rate announcement for Medicare Advantage and prescription drug coverage. In 2025, payments from the government toward these plans are expected to rise 3.7% year over year, unchanged from an earlier proposed rate. Humana lost more than 14%, while UnitedHealth dropped 7.5% and CVS Health tumbled roughly 8%. " type="dict">

		<key name="Private sector job growth expanded in March at its fastest pace since July 2023, indicating continuing buoyance in the U.S. labor market, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.Companies added 184,000 workers on the month, an increase from the upwardly revised February gain of 155,000, which also was the Dow Jones estimate for March.In addition to the strong employment pickup, ADP reported that wages for workers who stayed in their jobs increased 5.1% from a year ago, the same rate as February after showing a steady easing going well back into 2023. Those switching jobs saw gains of 10%, also higher than in previous months.&quot;March was surprising not just for the pay gains, but the sectors that recorded them,&quot; said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. &quot;Inflation has been cooling, but our data shows pay is heating up in both goods and services.&quot;Job gains were fairly broad-based, led by leisure and hospitality with 63,000. Other sectors showing significant increases included construction (33,000), trade, transportation and utilities (29,000), and education and health services (17,000). Professional and business services saw a loss of 8,000.Services-related industries accounted for 142,000 of the total, with goods providing the rest. ADP, whose survey is based on payroll data analysis of more than 25 million workers, does not track government jobs.Most of the growth came from companies that employ more than 50 workers, with small businesses adding just 16,000 to the total. From a regional standpoint, the South saw the biggest gains, adding 91,000 workers.The ADP estimate serves as a precursor to the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls survey, set to be released Friday, though the numbers often diverge sharply. The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported job growth of 275,000 in February, or 120,000 more than even ADP's revised figure. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the March count to show growth of 200,000.Solid payroll growth along with easing inflation has allowed the Federal Reserve to be patient in its approach to easing monetary policy. Central bank officials expect to start cutting interest rates later this year but have said in recent days that they haven't seen enough evidence yet that inflation is on a sustained path lower to begin reductions.

		<key name="Billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen said Wednesday that it will be difficult for the Federal Reserve to get inflation back down to its 2% goal.&quot;The Fed thinks it's eventually going to come down to a 2% inflation rate. ... I think that's going to be hard,&quot; Cohen told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on &quot;Squawk Box.&quot;Inflation was falling in late 2023, but there were several upside surprises in that data during the first quarter of this year. That has led to concern among economists and traders that inflation may prove to be &quot;sticky&quot; above the Fed's target level, complicating the path for rate cuts.The Point72 CEO said Wednesday that there's a lot of &quot;underemployment&quot; in the country, which could create upward pressure on inflation if economic growth remains strong.&quot;If growth is too fast, then you start getting constraints on labor and wages go up, and that may be a problem. ... We're in one of these problems where I don't think many people know exactly what is going to happen,&quot; Cohen said.Despite his concerns on inflation, Cohen said he doesn't disagree with market estimates of three cuts this year.&quot;I think inflation's been somewhat contained, and I think ultimately it will come down to: is that a true statement or not,&quot; Cohen said.Cohen also expressed general confidence in the stock market. He said the current market rally is not a bubble like 1999's dotcom boom and is instead due in part to investors pricing in future growth from artificial intelligence.Cohen said that AI is a &quot;really durable theme&quot; that will make an impact on a wide variety of companies.&quot;If you're a company and you're not thinking about this, you're going to wake up one day and go 'we're in trouble,'&quot; Cohen said.Cohen has a long history of successful stock trading, and he made much of his fortune as a hedge fund manager at S.A.C. Capital before the firm was shuttered following a regulatory investigation. He also owns the New York Mets. " type="dict">

		<key name="Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday it will take a while for policymakers to evaluate the current state of inflation, keeping the timing of potential interest rate cuts uncertain.Speaking specifically about stronger-than-expected price pressures to start the year, the central bank leader said he and his fellow officials are in no rush to ease monetary policy.Watch Fed Chair Powell speak live at Stanford policy conference economic forum&quot;On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,&quot; Powell said in remarks ahead of a question-and-answer session at Stanford University.&quot;We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent,&quot; he added. &quot;Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy.&quot;The remarks come two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold benchmark short-term borrowing rates steady. In addition, the committee's post-meeting statement on March 20 included the &quot;greater confidence&quot; qualifier needed before cutting.Markets widely expect the FOMC to start easing policy this year, though they have had to recalibrate their outlook for the timing and extent of cuts as inflation has held stubbornly higher. Other economic variables, particularly in the labor market and consumer spending, have held up as well, giving the Fed time to assess the current state of affairs before moving.The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed a 12-month rate of 2.5% for February, or 2.8% for the pivotal core measure that excludes food and energy. Virtually all other inflation gauges show rates in excess of 3%.&quot;Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected,&quot; Powell said. &quot;The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.&quot;Other Fed officials speaking this week have made remarks consistent with the Fed's patient approach.Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC on Wednesday that he thinks just one cut might be in the offing as prices of some important items have turned higher. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said three cuts is a &quot;reasonable baseline&quot; but noted there are no guarantees, while Cleveland's Loretta Mester also said cuts are likely later this year while adding that rates over the longer term may be higher than anticipated. All three are FOMC voters.Powell reiterated that decisions are being made &quot;meeting by meeting&quot; and noted only that cuts are &quot;likely to be appropriate ... at some point this year.&quot;The uncertainty about rates has caused some consternation in markets, with stocks falling sharply earlier this week as Treasury yields moved higher. The market stabilized Wednesday, but traders in the fed funds futures market again repriced their rate expectations, casting some doubt on a June cut as the market-implied probability moved to about 54% at one point, according to CME Group data.Along with his comments on rates, Powell spent some time discussing Fed independence.With the presidential election campaign heating up, Powell noted the importance of steering clear of political issues.&quot;Our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to the public,&quot; he said. &quot;We will not always get it right — no one does. But our decisions will always reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and longer term — and nothing else.&quot;He also talked about &quot;mission creep,&quot; specifically as it relates to some demand for the Fed to get involved in climate change issues and the preparations financial institutions take for related events.&quot;We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers,&quot; he said.

		<key name="In this article Disney shareholders on Wednesday reelected the media conglomerate's full board, preliminary results show, handing a stinging defeat to activist Nelson Peltz and former Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter, both of whom agitated for change at one of America's most storied companies.The widely expected victory caps a combative months-long process and affirms the board's decisions, from the move to bring back CEO Bob Iger to his efforts to re-invigorate the $223 billion media company. Peltz and Trian wanted to oust two directors — Maria Elena Lagomasino and Michael Froman — citing sustained share underperformance, a failed succession process, and billions in misdirected investments.Peltz lost to Lagomasino by a two-to-one margin, a person familiar with the matter said. Retail voters overwhelmingly supported Disney, that person added, helping to deliver Iger 94% of the overall vote. Rasulo lost to Lagomasino by an even larger margin, five votes against for every one for. That person characterized it as Peltz's largest loss ever.Percentage-wise, turnout for the director vote was in the mid-sixties, another person familiar with the matter said. In 2023, around 63% of Disney shareholders voted.A second activist, Blackwells, also failed to win board seats in its own long-shot bid.&quot;I want to thank our shareholders for their trust and confidence in our Board and management. With the distracting proxy contest now behind us, we're eager to focus 100% of our attention on our most important priorities: growth and value creation for our shareholders and creative excellence for our consumers,&quot; Iger said in a release.Disney deployed significant resources in the proxy fight. The company called in support from its founding family, Star Wars creator George Lucas, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Pixar and Apple CEO Steve Jobs.&quot;While we are disappointed with the outcome of this proxy contest, Trian greatly appreciates all of the support and dialogue we have had with Disney stakeholders. We are proud of the impact we have had in refocusing this Company on value creation and good governance,&quot; Trian said in a statement.The company also spent an estimated $40 million fighting off Peltz. The full-court press worked. Disney's two largest shareholders, Vanguard and Blackrock, decided to back management in the final days before Wednesday's meeting.&quot;Blackwells' primary objective was achieved – keeping Nelson Peltz out of the Disney Boardroom,&quot; Blackwells said in a statement. &quot;The company would have benefited from any one of our candidates for the hard work needed over the next few years to advance this iconic company, but we respect the will of the shareholders and the outcome.&quot;Ultimately, the activists failed to convince enough retail or institutional shareholders that he had a meaningful plan to fix the House of Mouse. While Peltz's candidacy picked up meaningful support from proxy advisors and smaller institutional investors, shareholders were less compelled by former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo, whom Trian also nominated to the board.Peltz, who dislikes being called an activist but has orchestrated successful campaigns at iconic companies like PepsiCo, P&amp;G and Wendy's, controls a $3.98 billion stake in Disney, or about 2% of total shares outstanding. Most of those shares are owned by Perlmutter.With Disney shares up nearly 50% since Peltz's campaign first began, Trian and Perlmutter gained a lot despite their board defeat. Peltz is partially on the hook for an estimated $25 million spent on the fight, a small amount compared to the paper gains in the stake he controls.As it moves past the battle with Peltz, Disney still faces down unprecedented challenges. ESPN has shed subscribers for years, raising questions about whether it is prepared to go toe-to-toe with streaming upstarts. Disney's streaming business has spent billions to win subscribers and is losing money as it tries to catch up to market leader Netflix.Perhaps most significantly, the company is searching for a successor to Iger for the second time in five years. Disney's botched succession, where Iger's hand-picked replacement Bob Chapek was ousted just two years into his tenure, was a key point Trian used against the company.&quot;Thank you for your trust and confidence in the Disney project management, and the ambitious strategy we're implementing across our businesses to build for the future,&quot; Iger said after the preliminary vote was reported. &quot;Now that this distracting proxy contest is behind us, we're here to focus 100% of our attention on our most important priorities, growth and value creation for our shareholders and creative excellence for our consumers. Thank you again for your support and for your continued investment in this.&quot;There is evidence that major proxy advisors agreed with Peltz's argument that the board was ill-equipped to take on a second search process.Shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS both noted the succession issues in their recommendations to investors. Glass Lewis sided with Disney and asserted Iger's return, paired with this year's nominations of Morgan Stanley Chairman James Gorman and former Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch to the board, have given the company &quot;adequate opportunity to launch a more credible succession program and develop, communicate and execute on several key initiatives which appear to reasonably target acknowledged operational and financial weaknesses at Disney.&quot;Investors rallied around Disney in February after the company made a series of major announcements durings its earnings call, including that it had obtained the exclusive streaming rights to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert film, a $1.5 billion strategic investment in Epic Games as well as a flagship ESPN streaming service.Peltz called the slew of announcements a &quot;spaghetti-against-the-wall&quot; plan that was meant to &quot;distract shareholders.&quot;Shares of Disney have jumped 23% since Disney's fiscal first quarter earnings report in early February.Disclosure: Sky News is owned by Comcast, CNBC's parent company.

		<key name="In this article DETROIT – Ford Motor is delaying production of a new all-electric large SUV and pickup truck, as it shifts to offer hybrid options across its entire North American lineup by 2030.The Detroit automaker on Thursday said it will continue to invest in EVs, but it is postponing production of the three-row SUV at a plant in Canada from 2025 to 2027 to allow for the market to mature more. The pickup is being pushed back from late 2025 to 2026.The shift in EV plans is the latest for Ford and the entire automotive industry as adoption has been slower than many expected and production costs remain high.Ford last year said it would delay or cancel $12 billion in planned spending on new EVs due to the shifting market conditions as well as challenges to profitably building and selling the vehicles. It was not immediately clear whether the new delays were part of those plans.&quot;As the No. 2 EV brand in the U.S. for the past two years, we are committed to scaling a profitable EV business, using capital wisely and bringing to market the right gas, hybrid and fully electric vehicles at the right time,&quot; Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement.The three-row SUV was part of a roughly $1.3 billion investment to transition Ford's Oakville Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada, into a new electric vehicle hub. It was supposed to be Ford's first time completely retooling a North American facility producing gas-powered vehicles into one that manufactures EVs.&quot;The additional time will allow for the consumer market for three-row EVs to further develop and enable Ford to take advantage of emerging battery technology, with the goal to provide customers increased durability and better value,&quot; the company said in a release.Ford said it will continue to focus its EV efforts on new plants such as its &quot;BlueOval City&quot; campus in Tennessee rather than transitioning current facilities producing engine-powered vehicles to all-electric models.&quot;Our breakthrough, next-generation EVs will be new from the ground up and fully software enabled, with ever-improving digital experiences and a multitude of potential services,&quot; Farley said.The automaker said the massive Tennessee facility, which was part of an $11.4 billion investment announced in 2021, will begin production of Ford's next-generation all-electric truck, codenamed &quot;T3,&quot; in 2026, rather than 2025.Ford said it is continuing construction of battery plants in Michigan, Tennessee and Kentucky.In the first quarter of 2024, Ford's electric vehicle sales increased by 86% from subdued levels a year earlier. Hybrid sales for the automaker rose 42% year over year, while sales of Ford's traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines were up 2.6%.Ford's &quot;Model e&quot; electric vehicle business lost $4.7 billion in 2023, including $1.57 billion during the fourth quarter. In February, the automaker said it expected the unit to lose between $5 billion and $5.5 billion in 2024. " type="dict">

		<key name="In this article Nelson Peltz's proxy battle was a &quot;distraction&quot; and Disney can now focus on trying to turn a streaming profit and planning its succession, its CEO Bob Iger said on CNBC's &quot;Squawk on the Street&quot; on Thursday, just one day after handing a stinging defeat to the activist investor.&quot;One of the things that I feel great about right now is, put the victory aside, that I can spend all of my time with the management team and the board on executing against those priorities,&quot; he said.While Disney rolled out a string of initiatives to boost shares in recent months as the board battle went on, Iger noted that Peltz's second proxy attempt did little to affect the company's strategy for succession, business investments or its shift in content plans.Iger told CNBC that choosing his replacement &quot;is the board's No. 1 priority.&quot; He said Disney's succession committee, which was established when he returned to his post in late 2022, held a number of meetings in 2023, with plans for more in 2024. Iger noted that the activism has not changed Disney's succession process. Iger's contract runs to 2026.Iger spoke about the challenges Bob Chapek faced when he took over the company in 2020, including shutdowns of film and TV production, the closure of theme parks and the discontinuation of live sporting events. Chapek held the post for more than two years before Iger returned to it.&quot;Obviously, we all learn from the past, and we're prepared for this process to be successful,&quot; Iger said.In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Peltz said he did not have any personal vendetta against Iger but wanted to ensure the company had a leadership plan in place.&quot;The only issue I had with Bob was the succession plan, which again is at the feet of the board,&quot; he said.Iger also disputed the notion that Peltz's activism was responsible for recent company stock gains — a claim the investor has made himself.&quot;The market is reacting to how this company is performing,&quot; Iger said. &quot;It was not reacting really to the activist.&quot;Shares of Disney are up 32% year to date. They rallied in February after the company made a series of major announcements during its earnings call, including that it had obtained the exclusive streaming rights to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert film, made a $1.5 billion strategic investment in Epic Games and would launch a flagship ESPN streaming service.For months, Disney had battled against Peltz's Trian Fund Management, which sought two of the company's board seats. Peltz had publicly lambasted Disney for its sustained share underperformance, failed succession process and what he claimed was billions in misdirected investments.Peltz told CNBC he would not try to wage another battle against Disney if Iger follows through on plans to improve the company's performance.&quot;I hope Bob can keep his promises,&quot; Peltz said Thursday. &quot; I hope they can do all the things they assured us they were going to do. I'll watch and wait. If they do it, they won't hear from me again.&quot;Shareholders sided with Disney during Wednesday's investor meeting. Peltz lost his board seat race to Maria Elena Lagomasino by a 2-to-1 margin, and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo, whom Trian also nominated, lost to Lagomasino by a 5-to-1 margin, a person familiar with the matter said. Retail voters overwhelmingly supported Disney, that person added, helping to deliver Iger 94% of the overall vote.A second activist, Blackwells, also failed to win board seats in its own long-shot bid.Percentage-wise, turnout for the director vote was in the mid-60s, another person familiar with the matter said. In 2023, around 63% of Disney shareholders voted.Iger has done much to try to right the ship at Disney since returning to the helm of the company in late 2022. He undid a new corporate structure instituted by the short-reigning Chapek and pulled back on the number of film and television projects the company was producing. Iger also announced a plan last year to invest $60 billion in Disney's theme park, cruise and experience business over the next 10 years.Up next is a new bundled sports service with Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox, as well as a flagship standalone ESPN service, which will eventually be available directly through Disney+.&quot;What we're trying to do is basically serve sports fans in multiple ways,&quot; Iger said, adding that he doesn't expect significant cannibalization between the two products.Iger said the flagship ESPN service will have significantly more content than the ESPN component of the joint venture will have. He declined to disclose more about the joint venture, including a potential name or price point for the service. " type="dict">

		<key name="In this article In the months before Bed Bath &amp; Beyond declared bankruptcy last April, the former home goods titan was trapped in a crushing cycle. The retailer had been failing to pay its vendors on time, if at all. During the pivotal holiday season, some began requiring payment when goods were delivered or refusing orders altogether, which left Bed Bath unable to stock shelves. Running low on cash and needing a strong holiday quarter, the retailer's position — and in turn its relationship with vendors — only got worse. The cycle continued until the big boxer succumbed to bankruptcy, and was liquidated a few months later. Similar dynamics accelerated the demise of other once-ubiquitous retailers, such as RadioShack and Toys R Us. While the factors that led to their downfalls varied, failing to pay vendors on time is often a sign of financial distress or an early indicator of bankruptcy risk, experts have told CNBC.Retailers including Peloton, Saks, Express and Bath &amp; Body Works have often failed to pay their vendors on time in the last few months, according to new data from Creditsafe, a business intelligence platform that analyzes companies' financial, legal and compliance risks.Plenty of companies, including many that are healthy, leave bills unpaid for weeks or months. But when companies have sudden fluctuations in unpaid bills, at the same time their sales fall or debts rise, late-payment rates help to build a picture of which businesses could face financial risks in the coming months and years if their operations don't improve.In some cases, Peloton, Saks, Express and Bath &amp; Body Works were later on their bills than usual, indicating they could be struggling to manage cash flows or planning for revenue fluctuations.&quot;It is generally a telltale sign of financial distress,&quot; Perry Mandarino, the head of restructuring at B. Riley Securities, told CNBC in an interview. &quot;It's either they have liquidity issues, or they don't care.&quot; To be sure, late payments don't always signal financial troubles. Some large retailers with many vendors could have a healthy balance sheet, but because they have leverage they could decide to pay their suppliers when it's convenient to them, said Mandarino. Those instances are bigger issues for vendors than for retailers.In other cases, inconsistent payments could indicate cash flow issues, especially when companies aren't profitable and have high debt. It's not unusual for a business to pay a vendor 10 days late, if that's what it typically does. But if that cadence suddenly changes, it's cause for concern, said Mandarino. Creditsafe's insights are based in part on companies' payment history with suppliers, collected through its &quot;global network of partners and trade payment contributors.&quot; The firm uses the data and other insights to determine a company's credit risk. Investment banks also use the information when deciding lending terms with a company, or to gauge whether a business is in financial distress. The information is regularly updated, and the data used in this report was current as of last Wednesday.Creditsafe spokesperson Ragini Bhalla said payment data is only one factor the firm considers when assessing a company's financial health.Though the data &quot;doesn't represent a company's total trading behavior, analysis has proven that it is hugely predictive of a company's financial health and creditworthiness,&quot; Bhalla said.The connected fitness company paid most of its bills on time in November, but the percentage of late payments spiked in December. It dipped in January, before jumping again in February, according to Creditsafe's report.&quot;When the number of late payments increases like this, it's often indicative of financial challenges and poor cash flow forecasting,&quot; Creditsafe said.Peloton has consistently failed to reach positive free cash flow, it said in February when announcing fiscal second quarter earnings. CEO Barry McCarthy, who previously told employees that &quot;Cash is oxygen&quot; and &quot;Oxygen is life,&quot; aimed to achieve positive free cash flow by February. But the company has said it now expects to meet that goal during its fiscal fourth quarter, which concludes at the end of June. The company is struggling with cash flow partially because it's not selling enough of its exercise equipment, which is costly to make, according to an analysis of Peloton's securities filings. Demand has fallen since Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns ended.In the three months ended Dec. 31, Peloton reported a net loss of $194.9 million, while sales fell to $743.6 million, down 6% from a year earlier. The company is trying to return to growth by June, later than previously expected.Peloton makes plenty of money from subscriptions and could increase cash flow &quot;somewhat immediately&quot; if it focuses on sustaining its customer base rather than growing significantly, Simeon Siegel, senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets, told CNBC.&quot;My view is, you can have a brand that's simply a good brand that generates a lot of cash and none of us will ever complain about liquidity, but that's not what's happening, they have to want to do that,&quot; said Siegel. Siegel said he's not concerned about Peloton's burn rate. But if the company cannot boost sales or cut costs, his view could change next year when it will need to make payments toward its term loan, Siegel said. Peloton's term loan requires it to pay down at least $800 million of its convertible notes by next November to avoid triggering an early maturity, he said.A Peloton spokesperson called Creditsafe's data &quot;inaccurate&quot; and said it doesn't align with the company's own payment information.&quot;We have excellent relationships with our vendor partners and do not see the same fluctuations or monthly drivers in payment times that are being reported,&quot; the spokesperson said.Peloton uses a metric known as days payable outstanding (DPO) which it deems as being more accurate, the spokesperson said, and shows that payments are &quot;timely and consistent.&quot; The metric, which can be approximated with a simple formula using information from a company's public filings, shows on average how long it takes businesses to pay bills and invoices. Peloton's DPO was largely consistent over the last six quarters, but the number has ticked up until it jumped to 104 days in the three months ended Dec. 31, according to CNBC estimates. The DPO was 95.5 days in the year-earlier period.The spokesperson added that Peloton is not facing a liquidity crunch.&quot;Peloton is also adequately capitalized to execute our strategic objectives, and our access to capital remains strong. Our publicly reported cash and cash equivalents reinforce this,&quot; the spokesperson said.Creditsafe has classified Peloton as being at a &quot;high risk&quot; of failure.The private department store chain came under fire late last year after numerous vendors said Saks hadn't paid them, leading some brands to tighten orders or stop shipping products altogether. The rumors first arose on social media and were later confirmed by Business of Fashion. In a quarterly letter to vendors made public in December, CEO Marc Metrick insisted to his suppliers that the company has &quot;sufficient liquidity and a sound balance sheet,&quot; Women's Wear Daily reported. &quot;As we carefully manage our business against the industry wide softness in the U.S. luxury market, we are confident in our ability to continue meeting our financial obligations,&quot; Metrick wrote, according to the outlet. Creditsafe's data show a company increasingly behind on its bills. While Saks often made late payments last year, its on-time payments have dropped significantly since October 2023, the firm said.The average number of days that Saks is paying its bills late has also fluctuated.In response, a company spokesperson told CNBC, &quot;We believe the numbers you shared are incorrect.&quot;To keep operations afloat, Saks' parent company HBC secured $200 million in capital and amended the terms of its revolving credit facility in February. The liquidity infusion will be used for &quot;growth initiatives&quot; and &quot;general working capital purposes,&quot; the retailer said in a news release. Creditsafe has classified Saks as being at a &quot;high risk&quot; of failure.The apparel retailer's business has faced pressure as discretionary spending slows and it manages a mounting pile of debt.The company's operational spending rose in the first three quarters of its fiscal year from the prior year, according to its third-quarter earnings release. Express had about $280 million in debt as of Oct. 28, with just $34.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Its cash on hand improved from the prior-year period, but its ratio of assets to liabilities was under 1 at the time, indicating it didn't have sufficient assets to cover its liabilities, according to securities filings.In February, The Wall Street Journal reported Express is looking to restructure its debt and could be headed for bankruptcy if its lenders don't amend their repayment options or agree to give it more cash.Preventing bankruptcy also depends on whether Express's vendors will keep fulfilling orders without tightening payment schedules, which would only put more pressure on the retailer, the outlet said. Given the recent payment trends provided by Creditsafe, Express is already struggling to keep up.The average number of days that Express was paying its bills past the terms of its vendor contracts grew from nine in January to 15 in February. The percentage of payments that were late also increased in that time frame.&quot;This constant up-and-down pattern with the company's [payments] indicates that its cash flow isn't stable and is likely being affected by revenue changes, debt and other factors,&quot; said Creditsafe.Executives told analysts on the company's third-quarter earnings call that it's banking on an infusion of cash from the IRS under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to help keep operations afloat. Express expects to get at least $48 million back from the federal government, interim finance chief Mark Still said.He said the company is working with the IRS to move the claim forward &quot;given the importance of this receivable to our liquidity.&quot;In the meantime, Express's newly appointment CEO Stewart Glendinning, who took the helm of the company in September after CEO Tim Baxter resigned, said he's working on recovering the company's &quot;full profit potential,&quot; including by cutting more costs, he told analysts during Express's third quarter earnings call in November.As of Monday's close, Express's stock was down about 83% year to date. On March 6, it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange because it couldn't sustain a market capitalization of at least $15 million for 30 consecutive trading days.Express has not announced a reporting date for its fourth quarter and full-year results, which it reported last year on March 24. Creditsafe has classified Express as being at a &quot;high risk&quot; of failure.Express didn't return a request for comment on the report.The home and body care retailer has seen sales slump as demand for its candles and soaps normalized after a pandemic boom. But it's regularly profitable, and had enough assets to cover its liabilities in the three months ended Feb. 3, securities filings show. Still, its payment patterns have been &quot;erratic&quot; over the last year, according to Creditsafe. While it may not face imminent risk of default, an unpredictable payment history could weigh against Bath &amp; Body Works if it's looking to shore up fresh financing or secure new suppliers, said Bhalla, Creditsafe's spokesperson.The average number of days that Bath &amp; Body Works was paying its bills past the terms of its vendor contracts stood at 10 in September and October, and then grew to 22 and 28 in November and January, respectively. The percentage of payments that were late have also risen since December.Bloomberg data shows the average number of days that bills remained unpaid fell slightly from 37.63 in fiscal 2022 to 36.93 in fiscal 2023.&quot;Bath &amp; Body Works values being a good partner for our vendors,&quot; the company told CNBC. &quot;This is evident in our data — as reflected on reputable financial reporting platforms — which shows us providing consistent timely payment.&quot;Creditsafe has classified Bath &amp; Body Works as being at a &quot;moderate risk&quot; of failure.

		<key name="Stocks turned lower on Thursday with investors on edge this week ahead of the March jobs report due out on Friday. A spike in oil prices and fears the Federal Reserve could hold off further cutting interest rates added to the day's poor sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 306.94points, or 0.7%, resuming its slide this week after gaining 294 points earlier Thursday. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.5%, giving up a 0.9% gain. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.3%, meanwhile. Key stocks like Nvidia and Alphabet also gave up their gains on the day.Crude oil jumped midday, which coincided with the rollover in stocks Thursday. WTI oil topped $86 a barrel to its highest level since October, raising concerns about energy prices helping to reaccelerate inflation. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari also commented Thursday afternoon that he wondered if the central bank should cut rates at all if inflation remained sticky, adding to a recent chorus of Fed speakers talking conservatively about policy. The 10-year Treasury yield rose off the lows of the session on the Kashkari's comments and was last hovering around 4.33%. The benchmark Treasury yield had briefly touched 4.429% on Wednesday, a new high for the year.&quot;Investors right now are sort of taking a wait and see attitude,&quot; said Sam Stovall, CFRA Research chief investment strategist. &quot;The 10-year yield is the key driving force because of the concern of the Fed implying that they're in no hurry to cut rates, and therefore confirming the adage that the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates.&quot;The market remains expensive, given that the S&amp;P 500 is trading at a 33% premium to its long-term average, Stovall added.&quot;I find that to be a bit disconcerting,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it's just a matter of time, before we end up digesting some of these gains.&quot;So far this week, the S&amp;P 500 is down 1.3%, with three out of four days in the red. The 30-stock Dow has lost roughly 2% week-to-date, while the Nasdaq has dipped 0.4% during the week.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday maintained that while there is still room for interest rate cuts this year, policymakers will need more proof that inflation is moving toward the central bank's 2% guideline before rates can come down. The key March nonfarm payrolls report is due on Friday. The consensus expectation calls for a 200,000 rise in payrolls with an unemployment rate of 3.8%. In February, U.S. job growth totaled 275,000 while the unemployment rate rose to 3.9%. A too hot jobs report could further boost yields and keep pressure on the Fed to maintain higher rates.

		<key name="Job creation in March easily topped expectations in a sign of continued acceleration for what has been a bustling and resilient labor market.Nonfarm payrolls increased 303,000 for the month, well above the Dow Jones estimate for a rise of 200,000 and higher than the downwardly revised 270,000 gain in February, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.The unemployment rate edged lower to 3.8%, as expected, even though the labor force participation rate moved higher to 62.7%, a gain of 0.2 percentage point from February. A broader measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons held steady at 7.3%.In the key average hourly earnings measure, wages rose 0.3% for the month and 4.1% from a year ago, both in line with Wall Street estimates.Growth came from many of the usual sectors that have powered gains in recent months. Health care led with 72,000, followed by government (71,000), leisure and hospitality (49,000), and construction (39,000). Retail trade contributed 18,000 while the &quot;other services&quot; category added 16,000.The February revision was just 5,000 lower while the January revision brought that total up by 27,000 to 256,000, still well below the initial estimate of 353,000.&quot;This is another really strong report,&quot; said Lauren Goodwin, economist and chief market strategist at New York Life Investments. &quot;This report and the February report showed some broadening in terms of job creation, which is a very good sign.&quot;Despite the move lower in the broader unemployment level, the rate for Black people surged to 6.4%, a gain of 0.8 percentage point, tying the highest level since August 2022. Rates for Asians and Hispanics both fell sharply to 2.5% and 4.5%, respectively.A string of positive gains has kept unemployment below 4% since January 2022, though there have been some signs of cracks. For instance the level of household employment had grown only modestly over the past year, while temporary employment has declined sharply.However, the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, posted an even more robust gain in March, up 498,000, more than absorbing the 469,000 increase in the civilian labor force level.Gains tilted heavily to part-time workers in the household survey. Full-time workers fell by 6,000, while part-timers increased by 691,000. Multiple job holders rose by 217,000, to 5.2% of the total employment level.Markets have been keeping close watch over the employment data particularly as the Federal Reserve weighs its next moves on monetary policy. Stocks have tumbled this week amid concerns that a strong labor market and resilient economy could keep the central bank on hold for longer than expected.Stock market futures rose following the report while Treasury yields also added to gains.The Fed is looking to guide inflation back down to 2% annually, a goal that has proven elusive even as the rate of price gains has decelerated from its peak in mid-2022. Most measures have inflation running above 3%, though the Fed's preferred gauge is below that level.Market pricing is pointing toward the first interest rate cut coming in June, though several Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, this week indicated they prefer to take a cautious data-dependent approach. The BLS on Wednesday is scheduled to release its consumer price index reading for March.Correction: The unemployment rate edged lower to 3.8%. An earlier version misstated the move. " type="dict">

		<key name="The U.S. labor market surprised economists with its strength once again, adding more than 300,000 jobs in March, with a few key sectors continuing to fuel its growth.Health care and social assistance were the top sector for job gains — a common theme in recent years — adding 81,300 jobs. Government and leisure and hospitality were the next two strongest sectors, and together these top groups accounted for more than 60% of March's gains.Within health care, ambulatory services and hospitals combined to add 55,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Local government was another strong subgroup for hiring, growing by 49,000 jobs.Notably, the leisure and hospitality sector is now back to its pre-pandemic employment level, according to the BLS. Employment in this area, which includes bars and restaurants, fell dramatically in 2020 when many such establishments were closed for health concerns.The continued rebound of these jobs, along with strong months for sectors like construction, could be a sign that immigration is helping the labor market grow without putting too much upward pressure on wages. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the labor force participation has changed little in the past year despite consistent upside surprises for job gains.&quot;Last year, half of the growth in the labor force came from net immigration. There were 5.2 million additional jobs last year, thanks to net immigration. It's been the key to rebalancing the labor market. It's a huge part of the reason we've got the growth that we've got and the disinflation that we've had,&quot; Stony Brook University professor Stephanie Kelton said Friday on &quot;Squawk Box.&quot; " type="dict">

		<key name="Stocks rebounded Friday following the Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst session in more than a year as traders cheered a stronger-than-expected jobs report and looked past a jump in rates.The S&amp;P 500 gained 1%, while the 30-stock Dow climbed 305 points, or 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.1%. Despite Friday's rebound, all three indexes still headed for a losing week.Treasury yields jumped following the report showing that job growth totaled 303,000 in March. Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 200,000, according to Dow Jones estimates. Wages rose 0.3% for the month and 4.1% from a year ago, both in line with estimates.Investors are torn between wanting a strong economy to support further corporate earnings growth and wanting a weaker jobs market that will give the Federal Reserve the green light to begin cutting interest rates.&quot;Markets are understandably confused, but the underlying economic circumstances which are the actual data series being released, like the jobs report, just continue to affirm two things: strong employment growth … and that the economy is not anywhere near recession,&quot; said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group.&quot;At the end of the quarter, markets ran up a lot more than they should have, so there was going to be some selling pressure regardless this week,&quot; he continued, adding that this week's sell-off was accelerated by fears of escalation in the Middle East and inconsistent speeches from various Fed speakers.The Dow tumbled about 530 points, or 1.35%, on Thursday, marking its biggest daily drop since March 2023 and its fourth consecutive losing session. A jump in crude oil and comments from Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari, where he questioned if interest rates should come down amid sticky inflation, were behind the pullback.Overall this week, higher rates have plagued stocks. The Dow has led the three major indexes down this week, pacing for a loss of more than 2%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have slid around 1% and 0.7%, respectively. " type="dict">

		<key name="U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday said she would not rule out any measures, including potential tariffs, on China's green energy exports.&quot;I wouldn't rule out anything out at this point. We need to keep everything on the table. We want to work with the Chinese to see if we can find a solution,&quot; she said in an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen, when asking about the possibility of Washington imposing tariffs if China does not adjust its approach to industry incentives.&quot;I'm not thinking so much of export restrictions, as some shifts in their macroeconomic policy, and a reduction in the amount of, particularly local government subsidies, to firms,&quot; Yellen said.She nevertheless stressed the need to create a level playing field in the green technology space.&quot;We just want to make sure that we're not driven out of business, and that our firms and workers have opportunities in these industries which will be important ones in our future,&quot; she added.Yellen is currently in Beijing and is due to leave China on Tuesday. She arrived in Guangzhou on Thursday last week to connect with Chinese officials as fractious economic relations between the two countries continue.The U.S. has been increasingly voicing concerns about an oversupply of subsidized Chinese clean energy products — such as solar power, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries — that it can export to international markets at discounted prices, which the White House says harms the competitiveness of domestic firms. Washington's anxiety is shared by U.S. allies including Japan and Europe, as a glut of cheap Chinese products, such as solar panels, has flooded their markets.&quot;It's fine for China's firms to export in this industry, to develop it. But some of the techniques that they use — subsidizing their firms very heavily and then supporting them even when they're losing money ... this is something that's unacceptable from the U.S. point of view, and many of our allies feel the same way,&quot; Yellen said.The Treasury secretary said that other countries may also explore the possibility of imposing trade restrictions on China. The European Union is currently conducting an investigation into the possible &quot;dumping&quot; of subsidized Chinese electric vehicles into the region, which risks undermining its sizable automotive industry.The bloc has so far been resistant to implement such measures given its strong trade ties with the world's second-largest economy. Speaking on Monday ahead of a three-day trip to China, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was skeptical about the need for tariffs on Chinese EVs, a spokesperson said, according to Reuters.Chinese-built EVs are currently subject to sizable 27.5% tariffs in the U.S. — a policy imposed by former President Donald Trump over concerns around unfair trade practices by Beijing.The Biden administration had previously considered cutting the tariffs, but Yellen said they were now subject to a review following reports that they may be hiked further amid pressure from Republican lawmakers. China, meanwhile, has called for them to be curtailed.&quot;[China] have said for a long time that they would like to see them reduced,&quot; Yellen said.The Commerce Department launched an investigation in March into whether Chinese EV imports could pose national security risks, particularly given the large amounts of data &quot;connected&quot; car technologies can collect.It comes amid growing skepticism around the risks that Chinese technologies pose to U.S. national security. Last month, U.S. lawmakers passed a bill calling for Chinese tech giant ByteDance to divest its popular TikTok social media app in the U.S. or to face an effective ban.Asked whether she thought China would allow the sale of TikTok's assets to a U.S. company or U.S. investors, Yellen said she did not want to &quot;get ahead&quot; of developments.&quot;This is an important and profitable company, and I think they're concerned by the prospect that they would be forced out of the United States,&quot; she said.Washington has also proposed clamping down on other Chinese firms seen as antithetical to U.S. geopolitical and strategic interests. In particular, the Biden administration has said that it would impose sanctions on Chinese entities found to be aiding Russia's military and its war efforts in Ukraine.&quot;What we have made clear is that it is unacceptable to us for China to support Russia militarily. That doesn't say that China can't have a relationship with Russia,&quot; Yellen said.&quot;China and Russia do a lot of trade, [and] much of it is unproblematic, but anything that involves aiding Russia militarily in their brutal war against Ukraine is unacceptable to us and we have the ability to sanction it.&quot; " type="dict">

		<key name="The United States is prepared to sanction Chinese banks and companies, as well as Beijing's leadership, if they assist Russia's armed forces with the invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday.&quot;We stand ready to act if we see significant violations, especially by financial institutions,&quot; Yellen said in an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen in Beijing. &quot;Anything that involves aiding Russia's military in their brutal war against Ukraine is unacceptable to us and we have the ability to sanction it.&quot;President Joe Biden issued a new executive order in December that vested the Treasury secretary with the authority to sanction financial institutions that aided Russia's military-industrial complex.Yellen said the Treasury Department has &quot;not used this tool yet.&quot;China is &quot;entitled&quot; to have a relationship with Russia, she said, noting that much of the trade between the two countries is seen by the U.S. as non-problematic. But the provision of military aid from Beijing to Moscow could trigger sanctions. Yellen has been in China for several days already, meeting with officials including her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng. The Treasury secretary arrived in the city of Guangzhou on Thursday and traveled to Beijing over the weekend. She is scheduled to depart for Washington on Tuesday.Yellen was tasked with delivering a tough economic message on the visit, one that placed U.S. interests first while also seeking to stabilize the fraught diplomatic relationship between the world's two remaining superpowers. Yellen raised U.S. concerns about Chinese overcapacity in the green energy industry like solar panels, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries. Washington alleges that Chinese government subsidies for these products have vastly outpaced its domestic demand for them. If Chinese manufacturers can't find buyers for their green energy infrastructure at home, they might choose to dump their cheaper surplus products onto global markets,  and price out other companies.Chinese state media has publicly denied this, though Yellen said that in her meetings, officials &quot;understood that this is something that's very important to the U.S.&quot;Yellen did not rule out the possibility of higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, if China failed to address these concerns.The overcapacity issue is among the many trade tensions that have characterized the U.S.-China relationship in recent years. Former President Donald Trump's initial round of tariffs in 2017 effectively put economic and trade cooperation on ice for several years.  Biden has maintained many of those tariffs throughout his first term and has threatened to raise some.Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in California last November in an effort to thaw relations and reestablish high-level communications between the two governments.&quot;That's what we're trying to do,&quot; said Yellen. &quot;I feel our relationship in this economic sphere is in a much better place&quot; than it was a year ago, she said.

		<key name="President Joe Biden will unveil his new plan to forgive student debt on Monday, less than a year after the Supreme Court blocked his initial attempt.Biden wants this aid package to survive any legal challenges. As a result, the president has made the program narrower by targeting specific groups of borrowers for debt forgiveness, including those facing financial hardship.But one of the provisions under the new plan could still reach up to 25 million Americans. That's Biden's intent to &quot;cancel runaway interest.&quot;More from Personal Finance:Why gas is so expensive in CaliforniaCredit card users face 'consequences' from falling behindAfter Biden praises progress on inflation, economists weigh in&quot;These historic steps reflect President Biden's determination that we cannot allow student debt to leave students worse off than before they went to college,&quot; U.S. Undersecretary of Education James Kvaal said in a statement.Consumer advocates have long criticized the fact that interest rates on federal student loans may exceed 8%, which can make it tough for borrowers who fall behind or are on certain payment plans to reduce their balances.More than 25 million federal student borrowers owe more than they originally borrowed, according to the Biden administration.It estimates that, if its new plan is enacted as proposed, borrowers will get up to $20,000 of unpaid interest on their federal student debt forgiven, regardless of their income.Certain low- and middle-income borrowers may benefit even more.Single people who earn $120,000 or less, and married borrowers making $240,000 or under, could have the entire amount of interest that has accrued on their debt since they entered repayment canceled under Biden's plan.Borrowers would need to be enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan to qualify but shouldn't have to apply for the relief.&quot;Student debt interest capitalization has been keeping families from accessing their version of the American Dream,&quot; said Jaylon Herbin, director of federal campaigns at the Center for Responsible Lending. &quot;Erasing that debt will lessen the burden of student loan debt on millions of borrowers and allow them to pay off their loans in a timely manner.&quot;In addition to the cancellation of interest, Biden's new plan is also expected to forgive the debt of certain groups of borrowers, including those who:It's not entirely clear yet how financial hardship will be defined, but it could include those burdened by medical debt or high child care expenses, the Biden administration said.Biden originally attempted to cancel people's student debt through executive action, but he's now turned to the rulemaking process. The next step in that procedure is for the Biden administration to issue a proposed rule on its plan, which will be followed by a public comment period.The president hopes to begin forgiving student debt before the November election.

		<key name="In this article Jamie Dimon, the veteran CEO and chairman of JPMorgan Chase, said he was convinced that artificial intelligence will have a profound impact on society.In his annual letter to shareholders released Monday, Dimon chose AI as the first topic in his update of issues facing the biggest U.S. bank by assets — ahead of geopolitical risks, recent acquisitions and regulatory matters.&quot;While we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business — or how it will affect society at large — we are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary,&quot; Dimon said.The impact will be &quot;possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet.&quot;Dimon's letter, read widely in the business world because of his status as one of the most successful leaders in finance, hit a wide variety of topics. The CEO said that he had ongoing concerns about inflationary pressures and reiterated his warning that the world may be entering the riskiest era in geopolitics since World War II.But his focus on AI, first mentioned in Dimon's annual letter in 2017, stood out. The technology, which has gained in prominence since OpenAI's ChatGPT became a viral sensation in late 2022, can generate human-sounding responses to queries. Enthusiasm for AI has fueled the meteoric rise of chipmaker Nvidia and helped propel tech names to new heights.  JPMorgan now has more than 2,000 AI and machine learning employees and data scientists working on 400 applications including fraud detection, marketing and risk controls, Dimon said. The bank is also exploring the use of generative AI in software engineering, customer service and ways to boost employee productivity, he said.The technology could ultimately touch all of the bank's roughly 310,000 employees, assisting some workers while replacing others, and forcing the company to retrain workers for new roles.&quot;Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition,&quot; Dimon said. &quot;It may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well.&quot;Here are excerpts from Dimon's letter:&quot;Many key economic indicators today continue to be good and possibly improving, including inflation. But when looking ahead to tomorrow, conditions that will affect the future should be considered... All of the following factors appear to be inflationary: ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization of the world, restructuring of global trade, capital needs of the new green economy, and possibly higher energy costs in the future (even though there currently is an oversupply of gas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack of needed investment in the energy infrastructure.&quot;&quot;Equity values, by most measures, are at the high end of the valuation range, and credit spreads are extremely tight. These markets seem to be pricing in at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing — modest growth along with declining inflation and interest rates. I believe the odds are a lot lower than that.&quot;&quot;If long-end rates go up over 6% and this increase is accompanied by a recession, there will be plenty of stress — not just in the banking system but with leveraged companies and others. Remember, a simple 2 percentage point increase in rates essentially reduced the value of most financial assets by 20%, and certain real estate assets, specifically office real estate, may be worth even less due to the effects of recession and higher vacancies. Also remember that credit spreads tend to widen, sometimes dramatically, in a recession.&quot;&quot;There is little real collaboration between practitioners — the banks — and regulators, who generally have not been practitioners in business…. Unfortunately, without collaboration and sufficient analysis, it is hard to be confident that regulation will accomplish desired outcomes without undesirable consequences. Instead of constantly improving the system, we may be making it worse.&quot;&quot;Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent abhorrent attack on Israel and ongoing violence in the Middle East should have punctured many assumptions about the direction of future safety and security, bringing us to this pivotal time in history. America and the free Western world can no longer maintain a false sense of security based on the illusion that dictatorships and oppressive nations won't use their economic and military powers to advance their aims — particularly against what they perceive as weak, incompetent and disorganized Western democracies. In a troubled world, we are reminded that national security is and always will be paramount, even if its importance seems to recede in tranquil times.&quot;&quot;One common sense and modest step would be for social media companies to further empower platform users' control over what they see and how it is presented, leveraging existing tools and features — like the alternative feed algorithm settings some offer today. I believe many users (not just parents) would appreciate a greater ability to more carefully curate their feeds; for example, prioritizing educational content for their children.&quot;&quot;The acquisition of a major company entails a lot of complexity. People tend to focus on the financial and economic outcomes, which is a reasonable thing to do. And in the case of First Republic, the numbers look rather good. We recorded an accounting gain of $3 billion on the purchase, and we told the world we expected to add more than $500 million to earnings annually, which we now believe will be closer to $2 billion.&quot;JPMorgan acquired most of the assets of First Republic last year for more than $10 billion after regulators seized the firm amid the regional banking crisis.

		<key name="In this article Google is trying to make cloud computing more affordable with a custom-built Arm-based server chip. At its Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the company said the new processor will become available later in 2024.With the new Arm-based chip, Google is playing catch-up with rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft, which have been employing a similar strategy for years. The tech giants compete fiercely in the growing market for cloud infrastructure, where organizations rent out resources in faraway data centers and pay based on usage.Google parent Alphabet still derives three-quarters of revenue from advertising, but cloud is growing faster and now represents almost 11% of company revenue. The segment, which contains corporate productivity applications, is also profitable. Google held 7.5% of the cloud infrastructure market in 2022, while Amazon and Microsoft together controlled around 62%, according to Gartner estimates.Market leader Amazon Web Services introduced its Graviton Arm chip in 2018. &quot;Almost all their services are already ported and optimized on the Arm ecosystem,&quot; Chirag Dekate, an analyst at technology industry researcher Gartner, told CNBC in an interview. Graviton has picked up business from Datadog, Elastic, Snowflake and Sprinklr, among others.Alibaba announced Arm processors in 2021, and Microsoft did the same in November.Arm isn't completely new to Google, which started selling access to virtual machines, or VMs, that use Oracle-backed startup Ampere's Arm-based chips earlier this year.Porting applications to Arm machines has made sense for organizations seeking to reduce spending on cloud computing because of economic worries. When Arm Holdings filed to go public last year, it pointed to Amazon's claim that Graviton could give up to 40% better price performance than comparable server instances, such as the common &quot;x86&quot; model used by AMD and Intel processors.Google has used Arm-based server computers for internal purposes to run YouTube advertising, the BigTable and Spanner databases, and the BigQuery data analytics tool. The company will gradually move them over to the cloud-based Arm instances, which are named Axion, when they become available, a spokesperson said.Datadog and Elastic plan to adopt Axion, along with OpenX and Snap, the spokesperson said.Broader use of chips drawing on Arm's architecture might lead to lower carbon emissions for certain workloads. Virtual slices of physical servers containing the Axion chips deliver 60% more energy efficiency than comparable VMs based on the x86 model, Google cloud chief Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Arm chips, which are popular in smartphones, offer a shorter set of instructions than x86 chips, which are commonly found in PCs.The chips can also speed up applications.Axion offers 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based virtual machines in the cloud and 50% better performance than comparable VMs based on x86, Google said.&quot;I think it completes their portfolio,&quot; Dekate said.Correction: The Cloud Next conference is on Tuesday.

		<key name="The consumer price index accelerated at a faster-than-expected pace in March, pushing inflation higher and likely dashing hopes that the Federal Reserve will be able to cut interest rates anytime soon.The CPI, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the economy, rose 0.4% for the month, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 3.5%, or 0.3 percentage point higher than in February, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a 0.3% gain and a 3.4% year-over-year level.Excluding volatile food and energy components, core CPI also accelerated 0.4% on a monthly basis while rising 3.8% from a year ago, compared with respective estimates for 0.3% and 3.7%.Stocks slumped after the report while Treasury yields spiked higher.Shelter and energy costs drove the increase on the all-items index.Energy rose 1.1% after climbing 2.3% in February, while shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the weighting in the CPI, were higher by 0.4% on the month and up 5.7% from a year ago. Expectations for shelter-related costs to decelerate through the year have been central to the Fed's thesis that inflation will cool enough to allow for interest rate cuts.Food prices increased just 0.1% on the month and were up 2.2% on a year-over-year basis. There were some big gains within the food category, however.The measure for meat, fish, poultry and eggs climbed 0.9%, pushed by a 4.6% jump in egg prices. Butter fell 5% and cereal and bakery products declined by 0.9%. Food away from home increased 0.3%.Elsewhere, used vehicle prices fell 1.1% and medical care services prices rose 0.6%.Increasing inflation was also bad news for workers, as real average hourly earnings were flat on the month and increased just 0.6% over the past year, according to a separate BLS release.The report comes with markets on edge and Fed officials expressing caution about the near-term direction for monetary policy. Central bank policymakers have repeatedly called for patience on cutting rates, saying they have not seen enough evidence that inflation is on a solid path back to their 2% annual goal. The March report likely confirmed worries that inflation is stickier than expected.Markets had expected the Fed to start cutting interest rates in June with three reductions in total expected this year, but that shifted dramatically following the release. Traders in the fed funds futures market pushed expectations for the first cut out to September, according to CME Group calculations.&quot;There's not much you can point to that this is going to result in a shift away from the hawkish bent&quot; from Fed officials, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. &quot;June to me is definitively off the table.&quot;The Fed also expects services inflation to ease through the year, but that has shown to be stubborn as well. Excluding energy, the services index increased 0.5% in March and was at a 5.4% annual rate, inconsistent with the Fed's target.&quot;This marks the third consecutive strong reading and means that the stalled disinflationary narrative can no longer be called a blip,&quot; said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. &quot;In fact, even if inflation were to cool next month to a more comfortable reading, there is likely sufficient caution within the Fed now to mean that a July cut may also be a stretch, by which point the US election will begin to intrude with Fed decision making.&quot;Later Wednesday, the Fed will release minutes from its March meeting, providing more insight into where officials stand on monetary policy.Multiple Fed officials in recent days have expressed skepticism about lowering rates. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC that he expects just one cut this year, likely not coming until the fourth quarter. Governor Michelle Bowman said an increase may even be necessary if the data does not cooperate. " type="dict">

		<key name="Inflation jumped in March as prices for consumer staples such as gasoline edged higher and those for housing remained stubbornly high, suggesting inflation may be a bit stickier than it seemed just a few months ago, economists said.The consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 3.5% in March from a year ago, the U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday. That's up from 3.2% in February.CPI measures how fast prices are changing across the U.S. economy. It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.The March inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981. However, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%.Progress in the inflation fight has somewhat flatlined in recent months.&quot;The disinflation has stalled out,&quot; said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.&quot;The big rock in the way here is the cost of shelter,&quot; Zandi said.While housing costs have moderated, they account for the largest share of the CPI inflation index and &quot;are still growing strongly,&quot; he said.Despite progress having stalled, broader evidence doesn't suggest a renewed surge in inflation — though it may take longer than expected to bring the rate back to target, economists said. In fact, underlying inflation after stripping out shelter costs is already back to target, Zandi said.&quot;I still hold to the view that inflation is moderating,&quot; Zandi said. &quot;It's just taking frustratingly long to get there.&quot;Meanwhile, there's a silver lining: Household buying power has risen over the past year.The average worker's &quot;real&quot; hourly earnings — their pay after accounting for inflation — increased 0.6% from March 2023 to March 2024. It had earlier declined for two years during the Covid-19 pandemic as high inflation eroded workers' paycheck growth, but that trend has since reversed.More from Personal Finance:What's wrong with TikTok's viral savings challenges$1 million homes are now 'typical' in record number of U.S. citiesWho's eligible for Biden's new student loan forgiveness plan&quot;It's still, broadly speaking, a rewarding environment out there for workers,&quot; said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. &quot;The job market remains supportive and wage gains are helping to unwind some of damage done by the historic surge in inflation.&quot;Gasoline prices increased 1.7% from February to March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. This figure is adjusted to account for seasonal buying patterns.Average U.S. pump prices were $3.52 a gallon on April 1, up from $3.35 on March 4, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.The increase is largely attributable to higher oil prices. They've firmed amid a generally positive outlook for the global economy, meaning greater global oil demand, and controlled output among major oil-producing nations, meaning there hasn't been a glut of oil, economists said.Tensions in the Middle East may also be playing a role, Hamrick said.Higher gas prices may filter through to higher prices elsewhere, since they factor into transportation and distribution costs for goods and even services such as food delivery, he said.Higher energy prices are what worries Zandi most relative to inflation readings. It's likely the upward trend will continue in coming months, and the dynamic negatively impacts consumer buying power and sentiment, he said.&quot;Nothing does more damage to the economy more quickly than rising oil and gasoline prices,&quot; he said.The BLS said that motor vehicle insurance, medical care, recreation and personal care, in addition to shelter, were &quot;notable&quot; contributors to &quot;core&quot; inflation, a reading that strips out volatile energy and food prices.Shelter, motor vehicle insurance, medical care, apparel and personal care were notable contributors to monthly inflation from February to March, the agency said.The overall monthly CPI reading, 0.4%, was much higher than the roughly 0.2% that would be expected on a consistent basis to bring inflation back to normal, economists said.&quot;There is no improvement here; we're moving in the wrong direction,&quot; Hamrick said.&quot;The usual trouble spots persist,&quot; said Hamrick, who additionally called out costs for electricity and car maintenance and repairs.Meanwhile, some consumer categories have seen improvement.Prices fell for used cars and trucks, new vehicles and airline tickets between February and March, for example. They're also down over the past year, by 2.2%, 0.1% and 7.1%, respectively, according to CPI data.Lower prices for new and used cars should lead auto insurance and repair costs to fall as well, economists said.Grocery prices are another bright spot, they said.While some categories, such as eggs and pork chops, have seen recent upward movement, the overall &quot;food at home&quot; index stood at 0% on a monthly basis in both February and March.&quot;Food prices have come to a standstill,&quot; Zandi said. &quot;For most Americans, the thing that bothers them the most about inflation is high food prices.&quot;At a high level, supply-and-demand imbalances are what trigger out-of-whack inflation.For example, the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains for goods. Americans' buying patterns also simultaneously shifted away from services — such as entertainment and travel — toward physical goods since they stayed at home more, driving up demand and fueling decades-high goods inflation.Additionally, supply-and-demand dynamics in the labor market pushed wage growth to the highest level in decades, putting upward pressure on prices for services, which are more wage-sensitive.Now that supply-chain issues are &quot;pretty close to fixed,&quot; there's &quot;little scope&quot; for goods to contribute to disinflation moving forward, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics.&quot;You need services to take the mantle of disinflation,&quot; because goods have &quot;petered out,&quot; she added.Housing falls into the services category. It accounts for the largest share of the consumer price index, so disinflation in this category would likely have a large impact on inflation readings.So far, housing inflation has remained stubbornly high — even as economists have predicted it would start moderating any day given broadly positive trends in prices for new tenant rental leases, for example.&quot;It seems to be taking a bit longer than people thought,&quot; said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.&quot;It's coming,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just a matter of when.&quot; " type="dict">

		<key name="Federal Reserve officials at their March meeting expressed concern that inflation wasn't moving lower quickly enough, though they still expected to cut interest rates at some point this year.At a meeting in which the Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold short-term borrowing rates steady, policymakers also showed misgivings that inflation, while easing, wasn't doing so in a convincing enough fashion. The Fed currently targets its benchmark rate between 5.25%-5.5%As such, FOMC members voted to keep language in the post-meeting statement that they wouldn't be cutting rates until they &quot;gained greater confidence&quot; that inflation was on a steady path back to the central bank's 2% annual target.&quot;Participants generally noted their uncertainty about the persistence of high inflation and expressed the view that recent data had not increased their confidence that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent,&quot; the minutes said.In what apparently was a lengthy discussion about inflation at the meeting, officials said geopolitical turmoil and rising energy prices remain risks that could push inflation higher. They also cited the potential that looser policy could add to price pressures.On the downside, they cited a more balanced labor market, enhanced technology along with economic weakness in China and a deteriorating commercial real estate market.They also discussed higher-than-expected inflation readings in January and February. Chair Jerome Powell said it's possible the two months' readings were caused by seasonal issues, though he added it's hard to tell at this point. There were members at the meeting who disagreed.&quot;Some participants noted that the recent increases in inflation had been relatively broad based and therefore should not be discounted as merely statistical aberrations,&quot; the minutes stated.That part of the discussion was partly relevant considering the release came the same day that the Fed received more bad news on inflation.The consumer price index, a popular inflation gauge though not the one the Fed most closely focuses on, showed a 12-month rate of 3.5% in March. That was both above market expectations and represented an increase of 0.3 percentage point from February, giving rise to the idea that hot readings to start the year may not have been an aberration.Following the CPI release, traders in the fed funds futures market recalibrated their expectations. Market pricing now implies the first rate cut to come in September, for a total of just two this year. Previous to the release, the odds were in favor of the first reduction coming in June, with three total, in line with the &quot;dot plot&quot; projections released after the March meeting.The discussion at the meeting indicated that &quot;almost all participants judged that it would be appropriate to move policy to a less restrictive stance at some point this year if the economy evolved broadly as they expected,&quot; the minutes said. &quot;In support of this view, they noted that the disinflation process was continuing along a path that was generally expected to be somewhat uneven.&quot;In other action at the meeting, officials discussed the possibility of ending the balance sheet reduction. The Fed has shaved about $1.5 trillion off its holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by allowing up to $95 billion in proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off each month rather than reinvesting them.There were no decisions made or indications about how the easing of what has become known as &quot;quantitative tightening&quot; will happen, though the minutes said the roll-off would be cut by &quot;roughly half&quot; from its current pace and the process should start &quot;fairly soon.&quot; Most market economists expect the process to begin in the next month or two.The minutes noted that members believe a &quot;cautious&quot; approach should be taken.

		<key name="Stocks tanked on Wednesday after March inflation data came in hotter than expected, likely pushing off interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve that investors have been anticipating.Investor sentiment was further dampened following the release of March's Fed meeting minutes, which reflected officials' concerns that inflation isn't moving quickly enough toward the Fed's 2% target.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 408 points, or 1.1%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. With the exception of energy, all sectors in the broad market index were red for the day. Real estate fell around 4%, leading sector losses for the day. The S&amp;P 500 had been treading water in April in anticipation of this inflation report following a roaring start to the year where the benchmark rallied 10%, its best first-quarter gain in five years.The CPI in March rose 0.4% for the month and 3.5% year-over-year, versus estimates for a 0.3% monthly increase and 3.4% year over year, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, accelerated 0.4% from the previous month while rising 3.8% from a year ago, compared to estimates for 0.3% and 3.7%, respectively. CPI in April increased at a 3.2% annual pace for all items.Fed funds futures trading data now suggests just a 20.6% likelihood that the Fed will lower rates at its June meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Traders are now betting that the first rate cut will likely take place at the central bank's meeting in September.The 10-year Treasury yield, a benchmark for mortgage and other loans, soared back above 4.5% as March CPI reaccelerated from the prior month, defying a Federal Reserve hoping for inflation to slow back to its 2% target. The 2-year Treasury yield spiked to nearly 5%.Bank shares, including JPMorgan Chase, and industrial shares like Honeywell, respectively slipped 1% and 1.9% on worries higher rates will start to suffocate the economy. Once red-hot tech stocks Microsoft and Apple also pulled back 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. Small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 dropped 2.6%.&quot;As we continue to see multiple reports in a row that are higher-than-expected, it becomes more difficult for the Fed to advocate cutting rates any time soon,&quot; said Chris Zaccarelli, Independent Advisor Alliance chief investment officer.Although the markets have managed to shake off January and February's hot inflation data, signs of persistent inflation are fueling Wednesday's downturn, according to Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance.&quot;This is as good a catalyst as any. I don't think this is the end of the bull market. But I do think it's an excuse for a lot of people who have had a lot of gains, to take some of those gains off the table,&quot; Diton said.

		<key name="A measure of wholesale prices increased less than expected in March, providing some potential relief from worries that inflation will hold higher for longer than many economists had expected. The producer price index rose 0.2% for the month, less than the 0.3% estimate from the Dow Jones consensus and not as much as the 0.6% increase in February, according to a release Thursday from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.However, on a 12-month basis, the PPI climbed 2.1%, the biggest gain since April 2023, indicating pipeline pressures that could keep inflation elevated.Excluding food and energy, the core PPI also rose 0.2%, meeting expectations. Excluding trade services from the core level, the increase was 0.2% monthly but 2.8% from a year ago.The release comes a day after the BLS reported that consumer prices again rose more than expected in March, raising concerns that the Federal Reserve will be unable to lower interest rates anytime soon.On the producer price side, March's gain was pushed by services, which saw a 0.3% increase on the month. Within that category, the index for securities brokerage and other investment-related fees jumped 3.1%.Conversely, goods prices decreased 0.1%, flipping a 1.2% increase in February. Final demand costs for energy, which have been on the rise lately, actually fell 1.6% on the month. However, wholesale prices for final demand food and goods less food and energy climbed 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively.Though prices have been rising at the pump, the final demand index for gasoline fell 3.6%. That contrasted with the consumer price index, which showed gasoline up 1.7% on the month.Markets showed little reaction to the data, with futures tied to major stock indexes slightly higher though Treasury yields declined.In other economic news Thursday, initial filings for jobless benefits fell to 211,000, a decline of 11,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised level and below the 217,000 estimate from Dow Jones.Continuing claims, which run a week behind, increased to 1.82 million, up 28,000 for the period, according to the Labor Department release.The economic data points are being watched closely as the Federal Reserve contemplates its next moves on monetary policy.Wednesday's CPI release jolted markets, which had been anticipating an aggressive series of interest rate cuts this year. The report showed annual inflation running at 3.5%, well above the Fed's 2% target.The market now is pricing in the possibility of just two cuts this year, likely not starting until September, according to CME Group data.

		<key name="In this article Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday took aim at regulators who are increasingly blocking mergers, including the company's planned acquisition of robotic vacuum maker iRobot, which fell apart earlier this year amid antitrust concerns.&quot;I think it's really kind of a sad story,&quot; Jassy said in an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on &quot;Squawk Box&quot; after the Amazon chief released his annual shareholder letter. The acquisition stood to give iRobot a competitive boost against rivals, Jassy said, but regulators blocked the deal &quot;because they worry that we're going to feature our vacuum cleaner, the Roomba, vs. others, which of course is not our model.&quot;Amazon in January walked away from its plan to acquire iRobot for $1.7 billion after Europe's antitrust watchdog and the Federal Trade Commission said it raised competition concerns. iRobot laid off 31% of its staff, and its shares have plunged more than 75% so far this year.Jassy said the move showed that regulators &quot;trust these two large Chinese companies with maps of the inside of U.S. consumers' homes more than they do Amazon.&quot;The robotic vacuum industry has become increasingly crowded in recent years, with companies like China-based Anker, Ecovacs and Roborock, as well as SharkNinja, eating into iRobot's once-dominant share of the market.The iRobot decision also comes as global regulators have been more aggressive in attempting to block Big Tech companies from expanding further, with the Biden administration making antitrust enforcement in the tech sector a top priority.As megadeals have slowed to a crawl, tech companies have made a flurry of investments in artificial intelligence startups, seeking to gain a foothold in the burgeoning market. Amazon last month added $2.75 billion to its stake in AI startup Anthropic, which also counts Google as one of its biggest backers. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.Regulators have zeroed in on these partnerships as well, with the FTC launching an inquiry into the deals in January.&quot;I think people don't know what they can do right now,&quot; Jassy said. He urged regulators to be &quot;more reasonable&quot; in their stance on Big Tech deals.Amazon also faces an ongoing lawsuit by the FTC. The agency sued Amazon in September, accusing it of operating an illegal monopoly that stifles competition and raised prices for consumers, while increasing costs for sellers.The lawsuit centers on Amazon's sprawling third-party marketplace, which is the linchpin of its e-commerce business. The marketplace now accounts for more than 60% of goods sold on the platform, and includes numerous businesses that generate millions of dollars in annual revenue on the site.Through the years, Amazon has built a well-oiled fulfillment and logistics machine that enables it and third-party sellers to deliver products to customers at increasingly breakneck speeds. CNBC previously reported that a massive network of groups have sought to take advantage of Amazon's scale and lenient returns processes by carrying out fraudulent refunds.It's ballooned into a massive problem for retailers, costing them more than $101 billion last year, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Appriss Retail.When asked how Amazon is tackling returns fraud, Jassy said the company has teams charged with examining returned goods to make sure they're &quot;appropriate.&quot;&quot;At our scale, you find you get some of everything,&quot; he added.

There are clear signs of disinflation in lots of places, but the last mile of the inflation fight is going to be the most difficult,&quot; said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, referring to the Federal Reserve's ultimate goal of reaching 2% inflation.Meanwhile, New York Fed President John Williams said during an event Thursday that there is no need for a policy change in the near term.This comes on the back of a hotter-than-expected March consumer price index reading released Wednesday, which sparked a market sell-off.

		<key name="In this article JPMorgan Chase on Friday posted profit and revenue that topped Wall Street estimates as credit costs and trading revenue came in better than expected.Here's what the company reported compared with estimates from analysts surveyed by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:The bank said first-quarter profit rose 6% to $13.42 billion, or $4.44 per share, from a year earlier, boosted by its takeover of First Republic during the regional banking crisis last year. Per-share earnings would've been 19 cents higher excluding a $725 million boost to the FDIC's special assessment to cover the costs tied to last year's bank failures.Revenue climbed 8% to $42.55 billion as the bank generated more interest income thanks to higher rates and larger loan balances.But in guidance for 2024, the bank said it expected net interest income of around $90 billion, which is essentially unchanged from previous wording.That appeared to disappoint investors, some of whom expected JPMorgan to raise its guidance by $2 billion to $3 billion for the year. Shares of JPM slipped 4% in early trading.While the NII guidance &quot;strikes us as ultra-conservative (and now leaves room to be revised upward later on), we suspect the unchanged outlook will disappoint investors,&quot; Piper Sandler analyst Scott Siefers said Friday in a note.JPMorgan posted a $1.88 billion provision for credit losses in the quarter, far below the $2.7 billion expected by analysts. The provision was 17% smaller than a year ago, as the firm released some reserves for loan losses, rather than building them as it did a year earlier.While trading revenue overall was down 5% from a year earlier, fixed income and equities results topped analysts' expectations by more than $100 million each, coming in at $5.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called his company's results &quot;strong&quot; across consumer and institutional areas, helped by a still-buoyant U.S. economy, though he struck a note of caution about the future.&quot;Many economic indicators continue to be favorable,&quot; Dimon said. &quot;However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces&quot; including overseas conflict and inflationary pressures.Though the biggest U.S. bank by assets has navigated the rate environment well since the Federal Reserve began raising rates two years ago, smaller peers have seen their profits squeezed.The industry has been forced to pay up for deposits as customers shift cash into higher-yielding instruments, squeezing margins. Concern is also mounting over rising losses from commercial loans, especially on office buildings and multifamily dwellings, and higher defaults on credit cards.Still, large banks are expected to outperform smaller ones this quarter.Shares of JPMorgan have jumped 15% this year, outperforming the 3.9% gain of the KBW Bank Index.Wells Fargo and Citigroup also report quarterly results Friday, while Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report next week.  This story is developing.

		<key name="In this article Tesla will lay off more than 10% of its global workforce, according to a memo sent to employees by CEO Elon Musk.The company's shares were down 3% on Monday morning.&quot;As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,&quot; Musk said in the memo obtained by CNBC.&quot;As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally,&quot; the memo said.The memo was first reported by Electrek.Tesla had 140,473 employees as of December 2023.Tesla shares have taken a bruising in recent months, falling 31% year to date. While electric vehicle sales are still gaining popularity worldwide, their sales growth rate has slowed especially for Tesla. The company now faces more competition than ever.To end 2023, China's BYD temporarily dethroned Tesla as the world's top EV maker. Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi in March said it would sell its first electric car for far less than Tesla's Model 3.Musk has previously recognized that China, home to a large Tesla factory, may also house the company's strongest competition. &quot;There's a lot of people who are out there who think that the top 10 car companies are going to be Tesla followed by nine Chinese car companies. I think they might not be wrong,&quot; Musk said in November.Some would-be Tesla customers are now skipping the brand owing to Musk's incendiary rhetoricEarlier this month, Tesla reported its first annual decline in vehicle deliveries since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted production extraneous of demand — first-quarter deliveries fell by 8.5% on the year to 386,810 in the first quarter, with output down 1.7% from a year earlier and 12.5% sequentially despite discounts and incentives offered to customers throughout the quarter.More recently, Tesla trimmed the subscription price of its premium driver assistance system, marketed as its Full Self-Driving or FSD option, for U.S. customers. The move was sharply at odds with Musk's previous pledges that the FSD fee would only bulk up as Tesla added features and functionality to the system. Despite the brand name, the system does not make Tesla vehicles self-driving and requires a driver attentive to the road, ready to steer or brake at any time.But the squeeze on the company's operating margin — which came in at 8.2% in the fourth quarter, down from 16% a year earlier — remains, and Tesla has warned investors to brace that vehicle volume growth this year &quot;may be notably lower&quot; than the rate logged in 2023, saying it is &quot;currently between two major growth waves.&quot;Logistical challenges exacerbated Tesla's problems this year. The company's component supply was a casualty of disruptions caused by Yemeni Houthi maritime attacks in the Red Sea, while the automaker's gigafactory near Berlin was forced to briefly suspend production due to suspected arson at a nearby electricity substation.Tesla is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results on April 23.Here's the full memo from Musk (transcribed by CNBC):Over the years, we have grown rapidly with multiple factories scaling around the globe. With this rapid growth there has been duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas. As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity.As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally. There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.I would like to thank everyone who is departing Tesla for their hard work over the years. I'm deeply grateful for your many contributions to our mission and we wish you well in your future opportunities. It is very difficult to say goodbye.For those remaining, I would like to thank you in advance for the difficult job that remains ahead. We are developing some of the most revolutionary technologies in auto, energy and artifiical intelligence. As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, your resolve will make a huge difference in getting us there.Thanks,Elon " type="dict">

		<key name="The S&amp;P 500 retreated on Monday as rising yields overshadowed strong Goldman Sachs earnings, hot retail sales data and hopes that the conflict in the Middle East will not escalate further.The broad index slipped 1.1%, swinging into negative territory after trading up by as much as 0.9% earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 1.6% as Salesforce and other technology stocks were particularly hard hit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 185 points, or 0.5%, relinquishing an advance of more than 1% seen at session highs.Higher rates appeared to pour cold water on the market bounce seen Monday morning. The yield on the closely followed 10-year Treasury rose above the key 4.6% level in the session and touched its highest point since mid-November.Yields popped after data released Monday morning showed retail sales increased 0.7% in March, providing the latest indication that consumption remains strong despite inflationary pressures. That pace was higher than the 0.3% consensus forecast of economists polled by Dow Jones.Also weighing on investor sentiment was Iran's launch of drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night, marking the first direct attack on Israel from Iranian territory. While the majority of threats were intercepted, concerns of retaliation remain. Oil prices fell on Monday, giving up some gains after rising in the weeks leading up to the attack. But the commodity came off lows in afternoon trading, another factor providing downward pressure on the market.&quot;Historically, geopolitical shocks cause short-term volatility, not long-term market declines,&quot; said Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners. &quot;In this current environment, however, the risk of an extended period of volatility is higher, given the inflationary oil price shocks that may emanate from the heightened tensions in the Middle East.&quot;The Dow was led down by Salesforce, which dropped more than 6% on reports that the software company was in talks to acquire data management firm Informatica. On the other hand, fellow Dow member Goldman Sachs popped about 3% after beating Wall Street expectations on both lines in the first quarter.Monday's action adds to the prior tough week on Wall Street, as lingering inflation concerns and a poor start to the new corporate earnings season weighed on traders.

		<key name="Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. economy, while otherwise strong, has not seen inflation come back to the central bank's goal, pointing to the further unlikelihood that interest rate cuts are in the offing anytime soon.Speaking to a policy forum focused on U.S.-Canada economic relations, Powell said that while inflation continues to make its way lower, it hasn't moved quickly enough, and the current state of policy should remain intact.&quot;More recent data shows solid growth and continued strength in the labor market, but also a lack of further progress so far this year on returning to our 2% inflation goal,&quot; the Fed chief said during a panel talk.Echoing recent statements by central bank officials, Powell indicated the current level of policy likely will stay in place until inflation gets closer to target.Since July 2023, the Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate in a target range between 5.25%-5.5%, the highest in 23 years. That was the result of 11 consecutive rate hikes that began in March 2022.&quot;The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,&quot; he said. &quot;That said, we think policy is well positioned to handle the risks that we face.&quot;Powell added that until inflation shows more progress, &quot;We can maintain the current level of restriction for as long as needed.&quot;The comments follow inflation data through the first three months of 2024 that has been higher than expected. A consumer price index reading for March, released last week, showed inflation running at a 3.5% annual rate — well off the peak around 9% in mid-2022 but drifting higher since October 2023.Treasury yields rose as Powell spoke. The benchmark 2-year note, which is especially sensitive to Fed rate moves, briefly topped 5%, while the benchmark 10-year yield rose 3 basis points. The S&amp;P 500 wavered after Powell's remarks, briefly turning negative on the day before recovering.Powell noted the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed core inflation at 2.8% in February and has been little changed over the past few months.&quot;We've said at the [Federal Open Market Committee] that we'll need greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2% before [it will be] appropriate to ease policy,&quot; he said. &quot;The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.&quot;Financial markets have had to reset their expectations for rate cuts this year. At the start of 2024, traders in the fed funds futures market were pricing in six or seven cuts this year, starting in March. As the data has progressed, the expectations have shifted to one or two reductions, assuming quarter percentage point moves, and not starting until September.In their most recent update, FOMC officials in March indicated they see three cuts this year. However, several policymakers in recent days have stressed the data-dependent nature of policy and have not committed to set level of reductions.Correction: Powell's comments follow inflation data through the first three months of 2024 that has been higher than expected. An earlier version misstated the year. " type="dict">

Revenue fell 9% year-over-year, its steepest annual drop since 2012.The company previously expected to start production of the new EV models in the second half of 2025.Tesla reported 45 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $21.3 billion in revenue, falling short of the 51 cents in expected earnings per share and $22.15 billion in expected sales, per LSEG.Revenue fell from $23.3 billion a year before and from $25.17 billion in the previous quarter.Analysts of Bank of America said in an investor note Wednesday that Tesla's first-quarter results and leadership's commentary &quot;addressed key concerns&quot; and &quot;revitalized the growth narrative,&quot; prompting them to upgrade the stock from neutral to buy while maintaining their $220 price target.They also expressed bullish optimism that Tesla demonstrated a positive business outlook as it prepares to launch new vehicle models and license its driver assistance system.&quot;In the near-term the tide in news flow appears to suggest the risk to the stock is skewing more positively,&quot; the analysts wrote.UBS analysts on Tuesday reiterated their neutral rating of Tesla stock and lowered their price target to $147 from $160, saying they remain skeptical of the company's talk.&quot;Increasingly, TSLA is a play on autonomy, and while progress is being made, we are cautious on near-term viability,&quot; they wrote in a note. &quot;We see limited growth for current lineup and lack of clarity on what these 'new vehicles' could bring.&quot;— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

		<key name="With the economy humming along and the stock market, despite some recent twists and turns, hanging in there pretty well, it's a tough case to sell that higher interest rates are having a substantially negative impact on the economy.So what if policymakers just decide to keep rates where they are for even longer, and go through all of 2024 without cutting?It's a question that, despite the current conditions, makes Wall Street shudder and Main Street queasy as well.&quot;When rates start climbing higher, there has to be an adjustment,&quot; said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. &quot;The calculus has changed. So the question is, are we going to have issues if rates remain higher for longer?&quot;The higher-for-longer stance was not what investors were expecting at the beginning of 2024, but it's what they have to deal with now as inflation has proven stickier than expected, hovering around 3% compared with the Federal Reserve's 2% target.Recent statements by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other policymakers have cemented the notion that rate cuts aren't coming in the next several months. In fact, there even has been talk about the potential for an additional hike or two ahead if inflation doesn't ease further.That leaves big questions over when exactly monetary policy easing will come, and what the central bank's position to remain on hold will do to both financial markets and the broader economy.Krosby said some of those answers will come soon as the current earnings season heats up. Corporate officers will provide key details beyond sales and profits, including the impact that interest rates are having on profit margins and consumer behavior.&quot;If there's any sense that companies have to start cutting back costs and that leads to labor market trouble, this is the path of a potential problem with rates this high,&quot; Krosby said.But financial markets, despite a recent 5.5% sell-off for the S&amp;P 500, have largely held up amid the higher-rate landscape. The broad market, large-cap index is still up 6.3% year to date in the face of a Fed on hold, and 23% above the late October 2023 low.History tells differing stories about the consequences of a hawkish Fed, both for markets and the economy.Higher rates are generally a good thing so long as they're associated with growth. The last period when that wasn't true was when then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker strangled inflation with aggressive hikes that ultimately and purposely tipped the economy into recession.There is little precedent for the Fed to cut rates in robust growth periods such as the present, with gross domestic product expected to accelerate at a 2.4% annualized pace in the first quarter of 2024, which would mark the seventh consecutive quarter of growth better than 2%. Preliminary first-quarter GDP numbers are due to be reported Thursday.For the past several decades, higher rates have not been linked to recessions.On the contrary, Fed chairs have often been faulted for keeping rates too low for too long, leading to the dot-com bubble and subprime market implosions that triggered two of the three recessions this century. In the other one, the Fed's benchmark funds rate was at just 1% when the Covid-induced downturn occurred.In fact, there are arguments that too much is made of Fed policy and its broader impact on the $27.4 trillion U.S. economy.&quot;I don't think that active monetary policy really moves the economy nearly as much as the Federal Reserve thinks it does,&quot; said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Kelly points out that the Fed, in the 11-year run between the financial crisis and the Covid pandemic, tried to bring inflation up to 2% using monetary policy and mostly failed. Over the past year, the pullback in the inflation rate has coincided with tighter monetary policy, but Kelly doubts the Fed had much to do with it.Other economists have made a similar case, namely that the main issue that monetary policy influences — demand — has remained robust, while the supply issue that largely operates outside the reach of interest rates has been the principle driver behind decelerating inflation.Where rates do matter, Kelly said, is in financial markets, which in turn can affect economic conditions.&quot;Rates too high or too low distort financial markets. That ultimately undermines the productive capacity of the economy in the long run and can lead to bubbles, which destabilizes the economy,&quot; he said.&quot;It's not that I think they've set rates at the wrong level for the economy,&quot; he added. &quot;I do think the rates are too high for financial markets, and they ought to try to get back to normal levels — not low levels, normal levels — and keep them there.&quot;As a matter of policy, Kelly said that would translate into three quarter-percentage point rate cuts this year and next, taking the fed funds rate down to a range of 3.75%-4%. That's about in line with the 3.9% rate at the end of 2025 that Federal Open Market Committee members penciled in last month as part of their &quot;dot-plot&quot; projections.Futures market pricing implies a fed funds rate of 4.32% by December 2025, indicating a higher rate trajectory.While Kelly is advocating for &quot;a gradual normalization of policy,&quot; he does think the economy and markets can withstand a permanently higher level of rates.In fact, he expects the Fed's current projection of a &quot;neutral&quot; rate at 2.6% is unrealistic, an idea that is gaining traction on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs, for instance, recently has opined that the neutral rate — neither stimulative nor restrictive — could be as high as 3.5%. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester also recently said it's possible that the long-run neutral rate is higher.That leaves expectations for Fed policy tilting toward cutting rates somewhat but not going back to the near-zero rates that prevailed in the years after the financial crisis.In fact, over the long run, the fed funds rate going back to 1954 has averaged 4.6%, even given the extended seven-year run of near-zero rates after the 2008 crisis until 2015.One thing that has changed dramatically, though, over the decades has been the state of public finances.The $34.6 trillion national debt has exploded since Covid hit in March 2020, rising by nearly 50%. The federal government is on track to run a $2 trillion budget deficit in fiscal 2024, with net interest payments thanks to those higher interest rates on pace to surpass $800 billion.The deficit as a share of GDP in 2023 was 6.2%; by comparison, the European Union allows its members only 3%.The fiscal largesse has juiced the economy enough to make the Fed's higher rates less noticeable, a condition that could change in the days ahead if benchmark rates hold high, said Troy Ludtka, senior U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities America.&quot;One of the reasons why we haven't noticed this monetary tightening is simply a reflection of the fact that the U.S. government is running its most irresponsible fiscal policy in a generation,&quot; Ludtka said. &quot;We're running massive deficits into a full-employment economy, and that's really keeping things afloat.&quot;However, the higher rates have begun to take their toll on consumers, even if sales remain solid.Credit card delinquency rates climbed to 3.1% at the end of 2023, the highest level in 12 years, according to Fed data. Ludtka said the higher rates are likely to result in a &quot;retrenchment&quot; for consumers and ultimately a &quot;cliff effect&quot; where the Fed ultimately will have to concede and lower rates.&quot;So, I don't think they should be cutting anytime in the immediate future. But at some point that's going to have to happen, because these interest rates are simply crushing particularly low-income-earning Americans,&quot; he said. &quot;That is a big portion of the population.&quot; " type="dict">

		<key name="U.S. economic growth was much weaker than expected to start the year, and prices rose at a faster pace, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.Gross domestic product, a broad measure of goods and services produced in the January-through-March period, increased at a 1.6% annualized pace when adjusted for seasonality and inflation, according to the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 2.4% following a 3.4% gain in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4.9% in the previous period.Consumer spending increased 2.5% in the period, down from a 3.3% gain in the fourth quarter and below the 3% Wall Street estimate. Fixed investment and government spending at the state and local level helped keep GDP positive on the quarter, while a decline in private inventory investment and an increase in imports subtracted. Net exports subtracted 0.86 percentage points from the growth rate while consumer spending contributed 1.68 percentage points.There was some bad news on the inflation front as well.The personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation variable for the Federal Reserve, rose at a 3.4% annualized pace for the quarter, its biggest gain in a year and up from 1.8% in the fourth quarter. Excluding food and energy, core PCE prices rose at a 3.7% rate, both well above the Fed's 2% target. Central bank officials tend to focus on core inflation as a stronger indicator of long-term trends.The price index for GDP, sometimes called the &quot;chain-weighted&quot; level, increased at a 3.1% rate, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3% increase.Markets slumped following the news, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 400 points. Treasury yields moved higher, with the benchmark 10-year note most recently at 4.69%.&quot;This was a worst of both worlds report – slower than expected growth, higher than expected inflation,&quot; said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US. &quot;We are not far from all rate cuts being backed out of investor expectations. It forces [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell into a hawkish tone for next week's [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting.&quot;The report comes with markets on edge about the state of monetary policy and when the Federal Reserve will start cutting its benchmark interest rate. The federal funds rate, which sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending, is in a targeted range between 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest in some 23 years though the central bank has not hiked since July 2023.Investors have had to adjust their view of when the Fed will start easing as inflation has remained elevated. The view as expressed through futures trading is that rate reductions will begin in September, with the Fed likely to cut just one or two times this year. Futures pricing also shifted after the GDP release, with traders now pointing to just one cut in 2024, according to CME Group calculations.&quot;The economy will likely decelerate further in the following quarters as consumers are likely near the end of their spending splurge,&quot; said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. &quot;Savings rates are falling as sticky inflation puts greater pressure on the consumer. We should expect inflation will ease throughout this year as aggregate demand slows, although the path to the Fed's 2% target still looks a long ways off.&quot;Consumers generally have kept up with inflation since it began spiking, though rising inflation has eaten into pay increases. The personal savings rate decelerated in the first quarter to 3.6% from 4% in the fourth quarter. Income adjusted for taxes and inflation rose 1.1% for the period, down from 2%.Spending patterns also shifted in the quarter. Spending on goods declined 0.4%, in large part to a 1.2% slide in bigger-ticket purchases for long-lasting items classified as durable goods. Services spending increased 4%, its highest quarterly level since the third quarter of 2021.A buoyant labor market has helped underpin the economy. The Labor Department reported Thursday that initial jobless claims totaled 207,000 for the week of April 20, down 5,000 and below the 215,000 estimate.In a possible positive sign for the housing market, residential investment surged 13.9%, its largest increase since the fourth quarter of 2020.Thursday's release was the first of three tabulations the BEA does for GDP. First-quarter readings can be subject to substantial revisions — in 2023, the initial Q1 reading was an increase of just 1.1%, which ultimately was taken up to 2.2%. " type="dict">
