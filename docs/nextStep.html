                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Text analysis serves as a powerful tool for understanding market trends. 
                        Throughout April, a noticeable correlation emerged between the headlines on CNBC and the prevailing market trends. 
                        We noticed that certain terms were connected to these upward and downward spikes in the market graph and studied the analysis between them to give us our data presented in our site. 
                    </p>

                <div class="container">
                    <h2>Things to Improve:</h2>
                    <h2>Content</h2>
                    <p>To enhance insights, we should consider collecting more data from a wider range of sources. 
                        This could be done by collecting from other new marketing sites like <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/">MarketWatch</a>, <a href="https://www.fool.co.uk/"> The Motley Fool UK</a>, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a>, just name a few.</p>
                    <h2>WebScraper</h2>
                    <p>Our webscraper had some issues with sentmient for a couple of words. We would do this differently in the future by double checking the sentiment of registered words by hand.</p>
                    <h2>Formatting</h2>
                    <p>Our file extensions got in our way for a bit in the beginning when our webscraper outputted the collected data as a JSON extension. In order to use our data, we had to change our Corpus extension to XML. This let us have more flexibility in processing our collected text. </p>
                    <h2>Sentiment Scope</h2>
                    <p>We could also further develop by training our natural language processing (NLP) models on a more comprehensive dataset. 
                        That would take the form of improving the accuracy and depth of your text analysis to better understand and predict market trends. 
                        This first became apparent to us when our first grouping of most frequent words included the term "said", which our NLP listed as the #1 most used term.</p>
