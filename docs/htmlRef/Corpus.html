                    <h2>Source of the Text Corpus</h2>
                    <p>Our text corpus comprises of headline articles from CNBC. We collect these articles hourly between 9 am and 4 pm on weekdays during April 2024. Unfortunately, I can't link directly to the source, as the collection is based on a custom web scraping script that retrieves headlines directly from CNBC's website.</p>

                    <h2>Preparation and Alteration for Analysis:</h2>
                    <p>Web Scraping: We use a custom Python script with Beautiful Soup to scrape headline articles from CNBC's website. The script runs on a DigitalOcean server via Crontab, ensuring consistent data collection.</p>
                    <p>Data Cleaning: After scraping, we clean the data to remove irrelevant information, such as HTML tags, unnecessary whitespace, and non-textual elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>ext Processing: The cleaned text is processed further to extract keywords, trends, and sentiment analysis. This includes tokenization, stopword removal, and other preprocessing techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>Data Aggregation: We aggregate the data to understand broader trends across the month and perform detailed analysis on individual headlines or clusters of headlines to assess specific stock market trends.</p>
