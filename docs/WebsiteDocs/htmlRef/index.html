                         <p>Video Games have been a part of my life as far back as i can remember. I remember the first console gaming device given to me was a <dfn>V-Smile</dfn>from my parents when I was only 6.

                     <p>Music is something that I rely on <dfn>every</dfn> single day of my life. Its my outlet for any emotions that are better conveyed through a song than just words themselves. My first instrument that I learned was the upright bass in 4th grade (the large wooden orchestral one). 
                         I've picked up quite a few more instruments since then. My full range of instruments include:</p>
                     <p>-Upright Bass</p>
                     <p>-Cello</p>
                     <p>-Electric Bass</p>
                     <p>-Ukulele</p>
                     <p>-Kalimba</p>
