                    <h2>What are the most significant challenges for a new learner?</h2>
                    <p>The first problem one might run into with Wordpress is the UI format. 
                        The styling one can choose from is limited with how many buttons there are under the visual and text tab. 
                        Everything else must come from html coding that constricts with its own method of formatting its elements. 
                        For example, since there is no css styling in one file, you have to include styling in each page or navigate to a custom css. 
                        Another example is how hidden themes are. They allow you to completely change your display with ease, but you wouldn't have guessed something so important is hidden between "Comments" and "Plugins" on your sidebar.</p>
                    
                    <p>Github can be even less forgiving than Wordpress. 
                        A new user has to learn about what a repository is and how to import file onto it. 
                        They will at least have to learn the basics of git commands in order to update their local and online files. 
                        Lastly, Github does not allow leniency in their file management. 
                        This means that if one file is placed or saved incorrectly to your local repo, you will not be able to correctly use it.</p>

                    <h2>What advantages do you associate with one method over the other?</h2>
                    
                    <p>The biggest advantage of using Wordpress is how simple it makes creating a site if you do not know anything about html whatsoever. 
                        Their layout of buttons are easy enough to understand that you are able to start creating an entire website in minutes. 
                        Although I lamented about the location of themes, it is quite convenient to choose from an entire list of pre-made layouts.</p>
                    
                    <p>Github's advantages lie within how much more freedom your content can be shared publicly online. 
                        I have outsourced to countless other repositories owned by strangers that have made exactly whatever I was looking for to a "T". 
                        If you are looking for some example coding to help with your own website, you can find it on someone else's repo if you look with a normal amount of effort. 
                        Github also has exceptional security SSH and PAT tokens to protect from any breaches.</p>

                    <h2>What challenges are there for modifying the layout and organization of each site?</h2>
                    
                    <p>Github's draw backs come in the brutal form of only html. 
                        If you want to indent, italicize, increase the font size, etc, you will have to code it manually in your styling or using elements.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although Wordpress makes it simple to add a theme or to edit formatting (similar to editingÂ  a document), there us much less convenience in opening and editing pages in succession. 
                        If you want to edit a different page, you will have to navigate through all pages and click on your specific page.</p>

                    <h2>What skills are necessary to learn and develop these sites in either format?</h2>
                    <p>The skills one needs for Wordpress are pretty limited. 
                        As I mentioned earlier with its advantages, you only need basic computer knowledge to develop a site.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the opposite end, there are quite a few necessary skills one needs to develop for Github. 
                        First and foremost, you will need to know html coding. 
                        There is no UI system to help you through your lack of knowledge except the red squiggly line of death. 
                        You will also have to know git commands if you wish to pull code from online and to push local code to your repo. 
                        File management is also needed due to its specific requirements.</p>

                    <h2>What skills do you think you want to learn to improve on this website?</h2>
                    
                    <p>Some skills I wanted to improve for Wordpress would be using custom css that I just learned was a thing here. 
                        I'm not quite sure if it will let me use id or classes, but its worth a try to see. Plugins would also be a good place to explore. 
                        I'm almost positive there has to be and html coder to integrate straight html coding.</p>
                    
                    <p>Github has so many avenues to improve yourself in. 
                        Git branching can help organize your global coding in case of crashes and loss of data. 
                        Knowing where your head is located can help you understand if you are in a branching tree or in main. 
                        Learning more overall html coding can always help as well. 
                        The more you know html, the less lines and time you have to spend.</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    
                    <p>I have worked with Github for years now and have to say that is my preference after having so much practice. 
                        I could definitely see the appeal of Wordpress if I had no experience with the other, but the style formatting is too scattered and limited. 
                        If you want to be better rounded for website development, I would choose Github in a heartbeat.</p>
